        "excerpt":"Minimal Mistakes has been developed as a [Gem-based theme](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/themes/) for easier use, and 100% compatible with GitHub Pages when used as a remote theme.  **If you enjoy this theme, please consider [sponsoring me](https://github.com/sponsors/mmistakes) to continue developing and maintaining it.**  [![\"Buy Me A Coffee\"](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1376749/120938564-50c59780-c6e1-11eb-814f-22a0399623c5.png)](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/mmistakes)  [![Support via PayPal](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/twolfson/paypal-github-button@1.0.0/dist/button.svg)](https://www.paypal.me/mmistakes) {: style=\"margin-top: 0.5em;\"}  ## Installing the theme  If you're running Jekyll v3.7+ and self-hosting you can quickly install the theme as a Ruby gem.  [^structure]: See [**Structure** page]({{ \"/docs/structure/\" | relative_url }}) for a list of theme files and what they do.  **ProTip:** Be sure to remove `/docs` and `/test` if you forked Minimal Mistakes. These folders contain documentation and test pages for the theme and you probably don't want them littering up your repo. {: .notice--info}  **Note:** The theme uses the [jekyll-include-cache](https://github.com/benbalter/jekyll-include-cache) plugin which will need to be installed in your `Gemfile` and added to the `plugins` array of `_config.yml`. Otherwise you'll throw `Unknown tag 'include_cached'` errors at build. {: .notice--warning}  ### Gem-based method  With Gem-based themes, directories such as the `assets`, `_layouts`, `_includes`, and `_sass` are stored in the theme’s gem, hidden from your immediate view. This allows for easier installation and updating as you don't have to manage any of the theme files.   To install as a Gem-based theme:  1. Add the following to your `Gemfile`:     ```ruby    gem \"minimal-mistakes-jekyll\"    ```  2. Fetch and update bundled gems by running the following [Bundler](https://bundler.io/) command:     ```bash    bundle    ```  3. Set the `theme` in your project's Jekyll `_config.yml` file:     ```yaml    theme: minimal-mistakes-jekyll    ```  To update the theme run `bundle update`.  ### Remote theme method  Remote themes are similar to Gem-based themes, but do not require `Gemfile` changes or whitelisting making them ideal for sites hosted with GitHub Pages.  To install as a remote theme:  1. Create/replace the contents of your `Gemfile` with the following:     ```ruby    source \"https://rubygems.org\"     gem \"github-pages\", group: :jekyll_plugins    gem \"jekyll-include-cache\", group: :jekyll_plugins    ```  2. Add `jekyll-include-cache` to the `plugins` array of your `_config.yml`.  3. Fetch and update bundled gems by running the following [Bundler](https://bundler.io/) command:     ```bash    bundle    ```  4. Add `remote_theme: \"mmistakes/minimal-mistakes@4.24.0\"` to your `_config.yml` file. Remove any other `theme:` or `remote_theme:` entry.  You may also optionally specify a branch, [tag](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/tags), or commit to use by appending an @ and the Git ref (e.g., `mmistakes/minimal-mistakes@4.9.0` or `mmistakes/minimal-mistakes@bbf3cbc5fd64a3e1885f3f99eb90ba92af84063d`). This is useful when rolling back to older versions of the theme. If you don't specify a Git ref, the latest on `master` will be used.  **Looking for an example?** Use the [Minimal Mistakes remote theme starter](https://github.com/mmistakes/mm-github-pages-starter/generate) for the quickest method of getting a GitHub Pages hosted site up and running. Generate a new repository from the starter, replace sample content with your own, and configure as needed. {: .notice--info}  ---  **Note:** Your Jekyll site should be viewable immediately at . If it's not, you can force a rebuild by **Customizing Your Site** (see below for more details). {: .notice--warning}  If you're hosting several Jekyll based sites under the same GitHub username you will have to use Project Pages instead of User Pages. Essentially you rename the repo to something other than **USERNAME.github.io** and create a `gh-pages` branch off of `master`. For more details on how to set things up check [GitHub's documentation](https://help.github.com/articles/user-organization-and-project-pages/).        You can also install the theme by copying all of the theme files[^structure] into your project.  To do so fork the [Minimal Mistakes theme](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/fork), then rename the repo to **USERNAME.github.io** --- replacing **USERNAME** with your GitHub username.        **GitHub Pages Alternatives:** Looking to host your site for free and install/update the theme painlessly? [Netlify][netlify-jekyll], [GitLab Pages][gitlab-jekyll], and [Continuous Integration (CI) services][ci-jekyll] have you covered. In most cases all you need to do is connect your repository to them, create a simple configuration file, and install the theme following the [Ruby Gem Method](#ruby-gem-method) above. {: .notice--info}  [netlify-jekyll]: https://www.netlify.com/blog/2015/10/28/a-step-by-step-guide-jekyll-3.0-on-netlify/ [gitlab-jekyll]: https://about.gitlab.com/2016/04/07/gitlab-pages-setup/ [ci-jekyll]: https://jekyllrb.com/docs/deployment/automated/#continuous-integration-service  ### Remove the Unnecessary  If you forked or downloaded the `minimal-mistakes-jekyll` repo you can safely remove the following folders and files:  - `.editorconfig` - `.gitattributes` - `.github` - `/docs` - `/test` - `CHANGELOG.md` - `minimal-mistakes-jekyll.gemspec` - `README.md` - `screenshot-layouts.png` - `screenshot.png`  **Note:** If forking the theme be sure to update `Gemfile` as well. The one found at the root of the project is for building the theme's Ruby gem and is missing dependencies. To properly setup a [`Gemfile`](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/blob/master/docs/Gemfile) with the theme, consult the \"[Install Dependencies](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/installation/#install-dependencies)\" section. {: .notice--warning}  ## Setup Your Site  Depending on the path you took installing Minimal Mistakes you'll setup things a little differently.  **ProTip:** The source code and content files for this site can be found in the [`/docs` folder](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/tree/master/docs) if you want to copy or learn from them. {: .notice--info}  ### Starting Fresh  Starting with an empty folder and `Gemfile` you'll need to copy or re-create this [default `_config.yml`](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/blob/master/_config.yml) file. For a full explanation of every setting be sure to read the [**Configuration**]({{ \"/docs/configuration/\" | relative_url }}) section.  From `v4.5.0` onwards, Minimal Mistakes theme-gem comes bundled with the necessary data files for localization. They will be picked up automatically if you have the [`jekyll-data`](https://github.com/ashmaroli/jekyll-data) plugin installed. If you're hosting on GitHub Pages, you can copy the [`_data/ui-text.yml`][ui-text.yml] file into your repository for the localization feature to work.  You'll need to create and edit these data files to customize them:  - [`_data/ui-text.yml`][ui-text.yml] - UI text [documentation]({{ \"/docs/ui-text/\" | relative_url }}) - [`_data/navigation.yml`][navigation.yml] - navigation [documentation]({{ \"/docs/navigation/\" | relative_url }})    [ui-text.yml]: https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/blob/master/_data/ui-text.yml   [navigation.yml]: https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/blob/master/_data/navigation.yml  ### Starting from `jekyll new`  Scaffolding out a site with the `jekyll new` command requires you to modify a few files that it creates.  Edit `_config.yml`. Then:  - Replace `/index.md` with a modified [Minimal Mistakes `index.html`](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/blob/master/index.html). Be sure to enable pagination if using the [`home` layout]({{ \"/docs/layouts/#home-page\" | relative_url }}) by adding the necessary lines to **_config.yml**. - Change `layout: post` in `_posts/0000-00-00-welcome-to-jekyll.markdown` to `layout: single`. - Remove `about.md`, or at the very least change `layout: page` to `layout: single` and remove references to `icon-github.html` (or [copy to your `_includes`](https://github.com/jekyll/minima/tree/master/_includes) if using it).  ### Migrating to Gem Version  If you're migrating a site already using Minimal Mistakes and haven't customized any of the theme files things upgrading will be easier for you.  Start by removing the following folders and any files within them:   ```terminal ├── _includes ├── _layouts ├── _sass ├── assets |  ├── css |  ├── fonts |  └── js ```  You won't need these anymore as they're bundled with the theme gem --- unless you intend to [override them](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/themes/#overriding-theme-defaults).  **Note:** When clearing out the `assets` folder be sure to leave any files you've added and need. This includes images, CSS, or JavaScript that aren't already [bundled in the theme](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/tree/master/assets).  {: .notice--warning}  From `v4.5.0` onwards, the default language files are read-in automatically via the [`jekyll-data`](https://github.com/ashmaroli/jekyll-data) plugin if it's installed. For sites hosted with GitHub Pages, you still need to copy the [`_data/ui-text.yml`][ui-text.yml] file because the `jekyll-data` plugin [is unsupported on GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/about-github-pages-and-jekyll#plugins).  If you customized any of these files leave them alone, and only remove the untouched ones. If done correctly your modified versions should [override](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/themes/#overriding-theme-defaults) the versions bundled with the theme and be used by Jekyll instead.  #### Update Gemfile  Replace `gem \"github-pages` or `gem \"jekyll\"` with `gem \"jekyll\", \"~> 3.5\"`. You'll need the latest version of Jekyll[^update-jekyll] for Minimal Mistakes to work and load all of the theme's assets properly, this line forces Bundler to do that.  [^update-jekyll]: You could also run `bundle update jekyll` to update Jekyll.  Add the Minimal Mistakes theme gem:   ```ruby gem \"minimal-mistakes-jekyll\" ```  When finished your `Gemfile` should look something like this:  ```ruby source \"https://rubygems.org\"  gem \"jekyll\", \"~> 3.7\" gem \"minimal-mistakes-jekyll\" ```  Then run `bundle update` and add `theme: minimal-mistakes-jekyll` to your `_config.yml`.  **v4 Breaking Change:** Paths for image headers, overlays, teasers, [galleries]({{ \"/docs/helpers/#gallery\" | relative_url }}), and [feature rows]({{ \"/docs/helpers/#feature-row\" | relative_url }}) have changed and now require a full path. Instead of just `image: filename.jpg` you'll need to use the full path eg: `image: /assets/images/filename.jpg`. The preferred location is now `/assets/images/` but can be placed elsewhere or externally hosted. This applies to image references in `_config.yml` and `author.yml` as well. {: .notice--danger}  ---  That's it! If all goes well running `bundle exec jekyll serve` should spin-up your site.

This is normal as they are bundled with the [`minimal-mistakes-jekyll`](https://rubygems.org/gems/minimal-mistakes-jekyll) Ruby gem.

If you plan to host with GitHub Pages be sure to properly setup [**jekyll-remote-theme**](https://github.com/benbalter/jekyll-remote-theme) as it is required for the theme to work properly.   **2.** For an **existing site** follow the steps outlined in the [*Quick-Start Guide*]({{ \"/docs/quick-start-guide/\" | relative_url }}). Then work through the guidelines below for migration and setup.  **3.** For those who'd like to make substantial edits to the theme, download as a ZIP file to customize.  [ Download Minimal Mistakes Theme](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/archive/master.zip){: .btn .btn--success}  **ProTip:** Be sure to remove `/docs` and `/test` if you forked or downloaded Minimal Mistakes. These folders contain documentation and test pages for the theme and you probably don't want them littering up in your repo. {: .notice--info}  **Note:** The theme uses the [jekyll-include-cache](https://github.com/benbalter/jekyll-include-cache) plugin which will need to be installed in your `Gemfile` and added to the `plugins` array of `_config.yml`. Otherwise you'll throw `Unknown tag 'include_cached'` errors at build. {: .notice--warning}  ## Theme migration  To move over any existing content you'll want to copy the contents of your `_posts` folder to the new site. Along with any pages, collections, data files, images, or other assets you may have.  Next you'll need to convert posts and pages to use the proper layouts and settings. In most cases you simply need to update `_config.yml` to your liking and set the correct `layout` in their YAML Front Matter.  [**Front Matter defaults**](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/configuration/#front-matter-defaults) are your friend and I encourage you to leverage them instead of setting a layout and other global options in each post/page's YAML Front Matter.  Posts can be configured to use the `single` layout --- with reading time, comments, social sharing links, and related posts enabled. Adding the following to `_config.yml` will set these defaults for all posts:  ```yaml defaults:   # _posts   - scope:       path: \"\"       type: posts     values:       layout: single       read_time: true       comments: true       share: true       related: true ```  **Post/Page Settings**: Be sure to read through the \"Working with...\" documentation to learn about all the options available to you. The theme has been designed to be flexible --- with numerous settings for each. {: .notice--info}  ## Install dependencies  If this is your first time using Jekyll be sure to read through the [official documentation](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/home/) before jumping in. This guide assumes you have Ruby v2 installed and a basic understanding of how Jekyll works.  To keep your sanity and better manage dependencies I strongly urge you to [install Bundler](http://bundler.io/) with `gem install bundler` and use the following `Gemfile`:  ```ruby source \"https://rubygems.org\"  # Hello! This is where you manage which Jekyll version is used to run. # When you want to use a different version, change it below, save the # file and run `bundle install`. Run Jekyll with `bundle exec`, like so: # #     bundle exec jekyll serve # # This will help ensure the proper Jekyll version is running. # Happy Jekylling!  # gem \"github-pages\", group: :jekyll_plugins  # To upgrade, run `bundle update`.  gem \"jekyll\" gem \"minimal-mistakes-jekyll\"  # The following plugins are automatically loaded by the theme-gem: #   gem \"jekyll-paginate\" #   gem \"jekyll-sitemap\" #   gem \"jekyll-gist\" #   gem \"jekyll-feed\" #   gem \"jekyll-include-cache\" # # If you have any other plugins, put them here! # Cf. https://jekyllrb.com/docs/plugins/installation/ group :jekyll_plugins do end ```  **ProTip:** To be bleeding edge install the latest (unreleased) version of Minimal Mistakes by adding this line to your `Gemfile`: `gem \"minimal-mistakes-jekyll\", :github => \"mmistakes/minimal-mistakes\"`. {: .notice--info}  To maintain a local Jekyll environment in sync with GitHub Pages replace the `gem \"jekyll\"` line with `gem \"github-pages\", group: :jekyll_plugins` and run the following:  ```bash $ bundle install ```  **Note:** The [GitHub Pages gem](https://github.com/github/pages-gem) installs additional dependencies that may need to be added to your `Gemfile` if you decide to remove the `gem \"github-pages\"` eg. `jekyll-paginate`, `jekyll-sitemap`, `jekyll-feed`, `jekyll-include-cache`, etc. {: .notice--warning}        Depending on what gems you already have installed you may have to run `bundle update` to clear up any dependency issues. Bundler is usually pretty good at letting you know what gems need updating or have issues installing, to further investigate.  When using Bundler to manage gems you'll want to run Jekyll using `bundle exec jekyll serve` and `bundle exec jekyll build`.  Doing so executes the gem versions specified in `Gemfile.lock`. Sure you can test your luck with a naked `jekyll serve`, but I wouldn't suggest it. A lot of Jekyll errors originate from outdated or conflicting gems fighting with each other. So do yourself a favor and just use Bundler. ","categories": [],

        "title": "Upgrading",
        "excerpt":"If you're using the [Ruby Gem]({{ \"/docs/quick-start-guide/#gem-based-method\" | relative_url }}) or [remote theme]({{ \"/docs/quick-start-guide/#remote-theme-method\" | relative_url }}) versions of Minimal Mistakes, upgrading is fairly painless.  To check which version you are currently using, view the source of your built site and you should see something similar to:  ```  ```  At the top of every `.html` file, `/assets/css/main.css`, and `/assets/js/main.min.js`.  ## Ruby Gem  Simply run `bundle update` if you're using Bundler (have a `Gemfile`) or `gem update minimal-mistakes-jekyll` if you're not.  When using Bundler you can downgrade or lock the theme to a specific release ([tag](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/tags)), branch, or commit. Instead of `gem \"minimal-mistakes-jekyll\"` you'd add the following to your `Gemfile`:  ```ruby gem \"minimal-mistakes-jekyll\", :git => \"https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes.git\", :tag => \"4.24.0\" ```  For more information on [installing gems from git repositories](http://bundler.io/v1.16/guides/git.html) consult Bundler's documentation.  ## Remote theme  When setting `remote_theme: \"mmistakes/minimal-mistakes@4.24.0\"` in your `_config.yml` you may also optionally specify a branch, [tag](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/tags), or commit to use by appending an @ and the Git ref.  For example you can roll back to release 4.8.1 with `mmistakes/minimal-mistakes@4.8.1` or a specific commit with `mmistakes/minimal-mistakes@bbf3cbc5fd64a3e1885f3f99eb90ba92af84063d`). For a complete list of theme versions consult the [releases page](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/releases).  To update the theme on GitHub Pages you'll need to push up a commit to force a rebuild. An empty commit works well if you don't have anything to push at the moment:  ```terminal git commit --allow-empty -m \"Force rebuild of site\" ```  ## Use Git  If you want to get the most out of the Jekyll + GitHub Pages workflow, then you'll need to utilize Git. To pull down theme updates you must first ensure there's an upstream remote. If you forked the theme's repo then you're likely good to go.  To double check, run `git remote -v` and verify that you can fetch from `origin https://github.com/{{ site.repository }}.git`.  To add it you can do the following:  ```terminal git remote add upstream https://github.com/{{ site.repository }}.git ```  ### Pull down updates  Now you can pull any commits made to theme's `master` branch with:  ```terminal git pull upstream master ```  Depending on the amount of customizations you've made after forking, there's likely to be merge conflicts. Work through any conflicting files Git flags, staging the changes you wish to keep, and then commit them.  ## Update files manually  Another way of dealing with updates is [downloading the theme](https://github.com/{{ site.repository }}/archive/master.zip) --- replacing your layouts, includes, and assets with the newer ones manually. To be sure that you don't miss any changes it's probably a good idea to review the theme's [commit history](https://github.com/{{ site.repository }}/commits/master) to see what's changed since.  Here's a quick checklist of the important folders/files you'll want to be mindful of:  | Name                   |     | | ----                   | --- | | `_layouts`             | Replace all. Apply edits if you customized any layouts. | | `_includes`            | Replace all. Apply edits if you customized any includes. | | `assets`               | Replace all. Apply edits if you customized stylesheets or scripts. | | `_sass`                | Replace all. Apply edits if you customized Sass partials. | | `_data/navigation.yml` | Safe to keep. Verify that there were no major structural changes or additions. | | `_data/ui-text.yml`    | Safe to keep. Verify that there were no major structural changes or additions. | | `_config.yml`          | Safe to keep. Verify that there were no major structural changes or additions. |  ---  **Note:** If you're not seeing the latest version, be sure to flush browser and CDN caches.

Detailed explanations of each can be found below.  ## Site settings  ### Theme  If you're using the Ruby gem version of the theme you'll need this line to activate it:  ```yaml theme: minimal-mistakes-jekyll ```  ### Skin  Easily change the color scheme of the theme using one of the provided \"skins\":  ```yaml minimal_mistakes_skin: \"default\" # \"air\", \"aqua\", \"contrast\", \"dark\", \"dirt\", \"neon\", \"mint\", \"plum\", \"sunrise\" ```  **Note:** If you have made edits to the theme's CSS files be sure to update [`/assets/css/main.scss`](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/blob/master/assets/css/main.scss) to include `@import \"minimal-mistakes/skins/{{ site.minimal_mistakes_skin | default: 'default' }}\"; // skin` before the `minimal-mistakes` import. {: .notice--warning}  #### Air skin: `air`  {:.no_toc}                 Calm and blue.   #### Aqua skin: `aqua`           Just like water.   #### Contrast skin: `contrast`           Retro feel with bold blue links and inverted footer.   #### Dark skin: `dark`           Inverted palette, white text on a dark background.   #### Dirt skin: `dirt`           Earthy tones.   #### Mint skin: `mint`  {:.no_toc}           Minty fresh green.   #### Neon skin: `neon`           Inverted palette, white text on a dark background.   #### Neon skin: `plum`           Purple reigns supreme.   #### Sunrise skin: `sunrise`           Oranges and red.   ### Site locale  `site.locale` is used to declare the primary language for each web page within the site.  _Example:_ `locale: \"en-US\"` sets the `lang` attribute for the site to the _United States_ flavor of English, while `en-GB` would be for the `United Kingdom` style of English. Country codes are optional and the shorter variation `locale: \"en\"` is also acceptable. To find your language and country codes check this [reference table]().  Properly setting the locale is important for associating localized text found in the [**UI Text**]({{ \"/docs/ui-text/\" | relative_url }}) data file. An improper match will cause parts of the UI to disappear (eg. button labels, section headings, etc).  **Note:** The theme comes with localized text in English (`en`, `en-US`, `en-GB`). If you change `locale` in `_config.yml` to something else, most of the UI text will go blank. Be sure to add the corresponding locale key and translated text to `_data/ui-text.yml` to avoid this. {: .notice--warning}  ### Site title  The name of your site. Is used throughout the theme in places like the site masthead and `` tags.  _Example:_ `title: \"My Awesome Site\"`  You also have the option of customizing the separation character used in SEO-friendly page titles.  _Example:_ `title_separator: \"|\"` would produce page titles like `Sample Page | My Awesome Site`.  **Note:** Long site titles have been known to break the masthead layout. Avoid adding a long \"tagline\" to the title prevent this from happening eg. `My Awesome Site is the Best Because I Say So`. {: .notice--warning}  ### Site subtitle  A short tagline that appears below the title in site masthead.  _Example:_ `subtitle: \"Version 2.0\"`  ### Site name  Used to assign a site author. Don't worry, you can override the site author with different ones on specific posts, pages, or collection documents.  _Example:_ `name: \"Michael Rose\"`.  **ProTip:** If you want to get crafty with your YAML you can use [anchors](http://www.yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html#id2785586) to reuse values. For example `foo: &var \"My String\"` allows you to reuse `\"My String\"` elsewhere in `_config.yml` like so... `bar: *var`. You'll see a few examples of this in the provided Jekyll config. {: .notice--info}  ### Site description  Fairly obvious. `site.description` describes the site. Used predominantly in meta descriptions for improving SEO.  _Example:_ `description: \"A flexible Jekyll theme for your blog or site with a minimalist aesthetic.\"`  ### Site URL  The base hostname and protocol for your site. If you're hosting with GitHub Pages this will be something like `url: \"https://mmistakes.github.io\"` or `url: \"https://mademistakes.com\"` if you have a custom domain name.  GitHub Pages now [forces `https://` for new sites](https://help.github.com/articles/securing-your-github-pages-site-with-https/) so be mindful of that when setting your URL to avoid mixed-content warnings.  **Note:** Jekyll 3.3 overrides this value with `url: http://localhost:4000` when running `jekyll serve` locally in development. If you want to avoid this behavior set `JEKYLL_ENV=production` to [force the environment](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/configuration/environments/) to production. {: .notice--warning}  ### Site base URL  This little option causes all kinds of confusion in the Jekyll community. If you're not hosting your site as a GitHub Pages Project or in a subfolder (eg: `/blog`), then don't mess with it.  In the case of the Minimal Mistakes demo site it's hosted on GitHub at . To correctly set this base path I'd use `url: \"https://mmistakes.github.io\"` and `baseurl: \"/minimal-mistakes\"`.  For more information on how to properly use `site.url` and `site.baseurl` as intended by the Jekyll maintainers, check [Parker Moore's post on the subject](https://byparker.com/blog/2014/clearing-up-confusion-around-baseurl/).  **Note:** When using `baseurl` remember to include it as part of your path when testing your site locally. Values of `url:` and `baseurl: \"/blog\"` would make your local site visible at `http://localhost:4000/blog` and not `http://localhost:4000`. {: .notice--warning}  ### Site repository  Add your repository name with organization to your site's configuration file, `_config.yml`.  ```yaml repository: \"username/repo-name\" ```  \"NWO\" stands for \"name with owner.\" It is GitHub lingo for the username of the owner of the repository plus a forward slash plus the name of the repository, e.g. `mmistakes/minimal-mistakes`, where **mmistakes** is the owner and **minimal-mistakes** is the repository name.  Your `site.github.*` fields should fill in like normal. If you run Jekyll with the --verbose flag, you should be able to see all the API calls made.  If you don't set `repository` correctly you may see the following error when trying to `serve` or `build` your Jekyll site:  **Liquid Exceptions:** No repo name found. Specify using `PAGES_REPO_NWO` environment variables, `repository` in your configuration, or set up `origin` git remote pointing to your github.com repository. {: .notice--danger}  For more information on how `site.github` data can be used with Jekyll check out [`github-metadata`'s documentation](https://github.com/jekyll/github-metadata).  ### Site scripts  Add scripts to the `` or closing `` elements by assigning paths to either `head_scripts` and/or `footer_scripts`.  For example, to add a CDN version of jQuery to page's head along with a custom script you'd do the following:  ```yaml head_scripts:   - https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.2.1.min.js   - /assets/js/your-custom-head-script.js ```  Consult the [JavaScript documentation]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _docs/17-javascript.md %}) for more information on working with theme scripts. {: .notice--info}  ### Site default teaser image  To assign a fallback teaser image used in the \"**Related Posts**\" module, place a graphic in the `/assets/images/` directory and add the filename to `_config.yml` like so:  ```yaml teaser: /assets/images/500x300.png ```  This image can be overridden at anytime by applying the following to a document's YAML Front Matter.  ```yaml header:   teaser: /assets/images/my-awesome-post-teaser.jpg ```        Example of teaser images found in the related posts module.   ### Site masthead logo  To insert a logo before the site title, place a graphic in the `/assets/images/` directory and add the filename to `_config.yml`:  ```yaml logo: \"/assets/images/88x88.png\" ```        Example of masthead with logo and custom title.   ### Site masthead title  By default your site title is used in the masthead. You can override this text by adding the following to your `_config.yml`:  ```yaml masthead_title: \"My Custom Title\" ```  ### Breadcrumb navigation (beta)  Enable breadcrumb links to help visitors better navigate deep sites. Because of the fragile method of implementing them they don't always produce accurate links reliably. For best results:  1. Use a category based permalink structure e.g. `permalink: /:categories/:title/` 2. Manually create pages for each category or use a plugin like [jekyll-archives][jekyll-archives] to auto-generate them. If these pages don't exist breadcrumb links to them will be broken.  ![breadcrumb navigation example]({{ \"/assets/images/mm-breadcrumbs-example.jpg\" | relative_url }})  ```yaml breadcrumbs: true  # disabled by default ```  Breadcrumb start link text and separator character can both be changed in the [UI Text data file]({{ \"/docs/ui-text/\" | relative_url }}).  ### Post dates  Enable post date snippets with `show_date: true` in YAML Front Matter.  ![post date example]({{ \"/assets/images/mm-post-date-example.png\" | relative_url }})  Instead of adding `show_date: true` to each post, apply as a default in `_config.yml` like so:  ```yaml defaults:   # _posts   - scope:       path: \"\"       type: posts     values:       show_date: true ```  To disable post date for a post, add `show_date: false` to its YAML Front Matter, overriding what was set in `_config.yml`.  When dates are shown on blog posts or pages, a date format will be chosen to format the date string. The default format is `\"%B %-d, %Y\"`, which will be displayed like \"February 24, 2016\". You can choose your date format by referencing this [cheat sheet](https://www.shortcutfoo.com/app/dojos/ruby-date-format-strftime/cheatsheet). For example, use your date format in `_config.yml`.  ```yaml date_format: \"%Y-%m-%d\" ```  ### Reading time  Enable estimated reading time snippets with `read_time: true` in YAML Front Matter. `200` has been set as the default words per minute value --- which can be changed by adjusting `words_per_minute:` in `_config.yml`.  ![reading time example]({{ \"/assets/images/mm-read-time-example.jpg\" | relative_url }})  Instead of adding `read_time: true` to each post, apply as a default in `_config.yml` like so:  ```yaml defaults:   # _posts   - scope:       path: \"\"       type: posts     values:       read_time: true ```  To disable reading time for a post, add `read_time: false` to its YAML Front Matter to override what was set in `_config.yml`.  `words_per_minute` can also be adjusted per-page basis by adding to its YAML Front Matter. This is useful for sites with multi-lingual content where you'd like specify a different value from the site config.  ```yaml words_per_minute: 250 ```  ### Page meta separator  To customise the separator between the page date and reading time (if both are enabled), edit `.page__meta-sep::before` in a [custom stylesheet]({{ \"/docs/stylesheets/\" | relative_url }}).  For example,  ```css .page__meta-sep::before {   content: \"\\2022\";   padding-left: 0.5em;   padding-right: 0.5em; } ```  ### Comments  [**Disqus**](https://disqus.com/), [**Discourse**](https://www.discourse.org/), [**Facebook**](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins/comments), [**utterances**](https://utteranc.es/), [**giscus**](https://giscus.app/) and static-based commenting via [**Staticman**](https://staticman.net/) are built into the theme. First set the comment provider you'd like to use:  | Name             | Comment Provider          | | ---------------- | ------------------------- | | **disqus**       | Disqus                    | | **discourse**    | Discourse                 | | **facebook**     | Facebook Comments         | | **staticman_v2** | Staticman v2 / v3         | | **staticman**    | Staticman v1 (deprecated) | | **utterances**   | utterances                | | **giscus**       | giscus                    | | **custom**       | Other                     |  Then add `comments: true` to each document you want comments visible on.  Instead of adding YAML Front Matter to each document, apply as a default in `_config.yml`. To enable comments for all posts:  ```yaml defaults:   # _posts   - scope:       path: \"\"       type: posts     values:       comments: true ```  If you add `comments: false` to a post's YAML Front Matter it will override the default and disable comments for just that post.  **Note:** Comments are disabled by default in `development`. To enable when testing/building locally be sure to set `JEKYLL_ENV=production` to [force the environment](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/configuration/#specifying-a-jekyll-environment-at-build-time) to production. {: .notice--info}  #### Disqus  To use Disqus you'll need to create an account and [shortname](https://help.disqus.com/customer/portal/articles/466208-what-s-a-shortname-). Once you have both update `_config.yml` to:  ```yaml comments:   provider: \"disqus\"   disqus:     shortname: \"your-disqus-shortname\" ```  #### Discourse  For guidance on how to set up Discourse for embedding comments from a topic on a post page, [consult this guide](https://meta.discourse.org/t/embedding-discourse-comments-via-javascript/31963).  ```yaml comments:   provider: \"discourse\"   discourse:     server: # meta.discourse.org ```  **Note:** Do not include `http://` or `https://` when setting your Discourse `server`. The theme automatically prepends the URL `//`, following a scheme-less pattern. {: .notice--info}  #### Facebook comments  To enable Facebook Comments choose how many comments you'd like visible per post and the color scheme of the widget.  ```yaml comments:   provider: \"facebook\"   facebook:     appid: # optional     num_posts: # 5 (default)     colorscheme: # \"light\" (default), \"dark\" ```  #### utterances comments  To use utterances you will need to [install the app](https://github.com/apps/utterances) to your GitHub repository by adding the following to `_config.yml`:  ```yaml repository: # GitHub username/repo-name e.g. \"mmistakes/minimal-mistakes\" ```  **Note:** Make sure the repo is public, otherwise your readers will not be able to view the issues/comments. The [issues feature](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/) also needs to be active on your repo. {: .notice--warning}  To enable utterances on the front end set `comments.provider` and the color theme of the widget.  ```yaml comments:   provider: \"utterances\"   utterances:     theme: \"github-light\" # \"github-dark\"     issue_term: \"pathname\"     label: \"comment\" # Optional - must be existing label. ```  #### giscus comments  To use giscus you will need to [install the app](https://github.com/apps/giscus) to your GitHub repository.  The next step is to go to  and fill out the desired settings. This will generate JavaScript that will provide you with the settings you will need to configure things below.  You'll need to ensure you've added the following to `_config.yml`:  ```yaml repository: # GitHub username/repo-name e.g. \"mmistakes/minimal-mistakes\" ```  **Note:** Make sure the repo is public, otherwise your readers will not be able to view the issues/comments. The [discussions feature](https://docs.github.com/en/discussions) also needs to be active on your repo. {: .notice--warning}  To enable giscus on the front end set `comments.provider` and the other additional options.  ```yaml comments:   provider: \"giscus\"   giscus:     repo_id              : # Shown during giscus setup at https://giscus.app     category_name        : # Full text name of the category     category_id          : # Shown during giscus setup at https://giscus.app     discussion_term      : # \"pathname\" (default), \"url\", \"title\", \"og:title\"     reactions_enabled    : # '1' for enabled (default), '0' for disabled     theme                : # \"light\" (default), \"dark\", \"dark_dimmed\", \"transparent_dark\", \"preferred_color_scheme\" ```  #### Static-based comments via Staticman  Transform user comments into `_data` files that live inside of your GitHub repository by enabling Staticman.  **Note:** Looking to migrate comments from a WordPress based site? Give [this tool](https://github.com/arthurlacoste/wordpress-comments-jekyll-staticman) a try. {: .notice--info}  **Note:** Please note that as of September 2018, Staticman is reaching GitHub API limits due to its popularity, and it is recommended by its maintainer that users deploy their own instances for production (use `site.staticman.endpoint`).  Consult the Staticman \"[Get Started](https://staticman.net/docs/index.html)\" guide for more info. {: .notice--warning}  ##### Add Staticman as a collaborator on GitHub (legacy)  1. Allow Staticman push access to your GitHub repository by clicking on **Settings**, then the **Collaborators** tab and adding your GitHub bot as a collaborator. 2. To accept the pending invitation visit: `https://{your Staticman v2/3 API}/v[2|3]/connect/{your GitHub username}/{your repository name}`.  **Note:** The new GitHub App authentication method is recommended for GitHub repositories to avoid the API rate limit. {: .notice--info}  ##### Configure Staticman  ###### Staticman v3  Due to the [support for GitLab](https://github.com/eduardoboucas/staticman/pull/219), the URL scheme has been changed.  Between `v3/entry/` and `/{your Git username}`, one needs to input a Git service provider (either `github` or `gitlab`).  For example      https://{your Staticman v3 API}/v3/entry/github/{your Git username}/{your repository name}/...  ```yaml # _config.yml (defaults) repository  : # Git username/repo-name e.g. \"mmistakes/minimal-mistakes\" comments:   provider  : \"staticman_v2\"   staticman:     branch    : \"master\"     endpoint  : https://{your Staticman v3 API}/v3/entry/github/ ```  ###### Staticman v2  Default settings have been provided in [`staticman.yml`](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/blob/master/staticman.yml) and are commented to guide you through setup. View the [full list of configurations](https://staticman.net/docs/configuration).  ```yaml # staticman.yml (defaults) comments:   allowedFields      : [\"name\", \"email\", \"url\", \"message\"]   branch             : \"master\"   commitMessage      : \"New comment by {fields.name}\"   filename           : \"comment-{@timestamp}\"   format             : \"yaml\"   generatedFields:     date:       type           : \"date\"       options:         format       : \"iso8601\"   moderation         : true   path               : \"_data/comments/{options.slug}\"   requiredFields     : [\"name\", \"email\", \"message\"]   transforms:     email            : md5 ```  These settings need to be added to your `_config.yml` file as well:  ```yaml # _config.yml (defaults) repository  : # GitHub username/repo-name e.g. \"mmistakes/minimal-mistakes\" comments:   provider  : \"staticman_v2\"   staticman:     branch    : \"master\" ```  **Branch setting:** This is the branch comment files will be sent to via pull requests. If you host your site on GitHub Pages it will likely be `master` unless your repo is setup as a project --- use `gh-pages` in that case. {: .notice--info}  **Note:** Staticman is currently compatible with GitHub and GitLab based repositories. [Support for GitLab Pages](https://github.com/eduardoboucas/staticman/issues/22) is already available at [Staticman v3](https://github.com/eduardoboucas/staticman/pull/219). {: .notice--warning}  ###### Staticman v1 (deprecated)  Default settings have been provided in `_config.yml`. The important ones to set are `provider: \"staticman\"`, `branch`, and `path`. View the [full list of configurations](https://staticman.net/docs/configuration).  ```yaml # _config.yml (defaults) comments:   provider: \"staticman\" staticman:   allowedFields          : ['name', 'email', 'url', 'message']   branch                 : \"master\"   commitMessage          : \"New comment by {fields.name}\"   filename               : comment-{@timestamp}   format                 : \"yml\"   moderation             : true   path                   : \"_data/comments/{options.slug}\"   requiredFields         : ['name', 'email', 'message']   transforms:     email                : \"md5\"   generatedFields:     date:       type               : \"date\"       options:         format           : \"iso8601\" # \"iso8601\" (default), \"timestamp-seconds\", \"timestamp-milliseconds\" ```  ##### Comment moderation  By default comment moderation is enabled in `staticman.yml`. As new comments are submitted Staticman will send a pull request. Merging these in will approve the comment, close the issue, and automatically rebuild your site (if hosted on GitHub Pages).  To skip this moderation step simply set `moderation: false`.  **ProTip:** Create a GitHub webhook that sends a `POST` request to the following payload URL `https://{your Staticman API URL}/v2/webhook` and triggers a \"Pull request\" event to delete Staticman branches on merge. {: .notice--info}  ![pull-request webhook]({{ \"/assets/images/mm-staticman-pr-webhook.jpg\" | relative_url }})  ##### reCAPTCHA support (v2 only)  To enable Google's reCAPTCHA to aid in spam detection you'll need to:  1. Apply for [reCAPTCHA API](https://www.google.com/recaptcha) keys and register your site using the reCAPTCHA V2 type. 2. Add your site and secret keys to `staticman.yml` and `_config.yml`. Be sure to properly encrypt your secret key using [Staticman's encrypt endpoint](https://staticman.net/docs/encryption).  ```yaml reCaptcha:   enabled: true   siteKey: # \"6LdRBykTAAAAAFB46MnIu6ixuxwu9W1ihFF8G60Q\"   secret: # \"PznnZGu3P6eTHRPLORniSq+J61YEf+A9zmColXDM5icqF49gbunH51B8+h+i2IvewpuxtA9TFoK68TuhUp/X3YKmmqhXasegHYabY50fqF9nJh9npWNhvITdkQHeaOqnFXUIwxfiEeUt49Yoa2waRR7a5LdRAP3SVM8hz0KIBT4=\" ```  #### Other comment providers  To use another provider not included with the theme set `provider: \"custom\"` then add their embed code to `_includes/comments-providers/custom.html`.  ### Custom feed URL  By default the theme links to `feed.xml` generated in the root of your site by the **jekyll-feed** plugin. To link to an externally hosted feed update `atom_feed` in `_config.yml` like so:  ```yaml atom_feed:   path: \"http://feeds.feedburner.com/youFeedname\" ```  **Note:** By default the site feed is linked in two locations: inside the [`` element](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/blob/master/_includes/head.html) and at the bottom of every page in the [site footer](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/blob/master/_includes/footer.html). {: .notice--info}  ### Disable Feed Icons  By default the theme links to `feed.xml` generated in the root of your site by the **jekyll-feed** plugin. To remove the RSS icon in the header and footer, update `atom_feed` in `_config.yml` like so:  ```yaml atom_feed:   hide: true ```  ### Site search  To enable site-wide search add `search: true` to your `_config.yml`.  ![masthead search example]({{ \"/assets/images/masthead-search.gif\" | relative_url }})  #### Lunr (default)  The default search uses [**Lunr**](https://lunrjs.com/) to build a search index of all post and your documents in collections. This method is 100% compatible with sites hosted on GitHub Pages.  To have it index all pages, update `lunr` in `_config.yml` like so:  ```yaml lunr:   search_within_pages: true ```  **Note:** Only the first 50 words of a post or page's body content is added to the Lunr search index. Setting `search_full_content` to `true` in your `_config.yml` will override this and could impact page load performance. {: .notice--warning}  #### Algolia  For faster and more relevant search ([see demo](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes-algolia-search/)):  1. Add the [`jekyll-algolia`](https://github.com/algolia/jekyll-algolia) gem to your `Gemfile`, in the `:jekyll_plugins` section.     ```ruby    group :jekyll_plugins do      gem \"jekyll-feed\"      gem \"jekyll-seo-tag\"      gem \"jekyll-sitemap\"      gem \"jekyll-paginate\"      gem \"jekyll-include-cache\"      gem \"jekyll-algolia\"    end    ```     Once this is done, download all dependencies by running `bundle install`.  2. Switch search providers from `lunr` to `algolia` in your `_config.yml` file:     ```yaml    search_provider: algolia    ```  3. Add the following Algolia credentials to your `_config.yml` file. *If you don't have an Algolia account, you can open a free [Community plan](https://www.algolia.com/users/sign_up/hacker). Once signed in, you can grab your credentials from [your dashboard](https://www.algolia.com/licensing).*     ```yaml    algolia:      application_id: # YOUR_APPLICATION_ID      index_name: # YOUR_INDEX_NAME      search_only_api_key: # YOUR_SEARCH_ONLY_API_KEY      powered_by: # true (default), false    ```  4. Once your credentials are setup, you can run the indexing with the following command:     ```    ALGOLIA_API_KEY=your_admin_api_key bundle exec jekyll algolia    ```     For Windows users you will have to use `set` to assigned the `ALGOLIA_API_KEY` environment variable.     ```    set ALGOLIA_API_KEY=your_admin_api_key    bundle exec jekyll algolia    ```     Note that `ALGOLIA_API_KEY` should be set to your admin API key.  To use the Algolia search with GitHub Pages hosted sites follow [this deployment guide](https://community.algolia.com/jekyll-algolia/github-pages.html). Or this guide for [deploying on Netlify](https://community.algolia.com/jekyll-algolia/netlify.html).  **Note:** The Jekyll Algolia plugin can be configured in several ways. Be sure to check out [their full documentation](https://community.algolia.com/jekyll-algolia/options.html \"Algolia configuration\") on how to exclude files and other valuable settings. {: .notice--info}  #### Google Custom Search Engine  Add a Google search box to your site.  1. Create a **New search engine** in [Google Custom Search Engine](https://cse.google.com/cse/all), give it an appropriate name and setup \"Sites to search\" to your liking.  2. Under **Look and feel** choose the \"Results only\" layout and a theme (*Minimalist* is a good choice to match the default look of the Minimal Mistakes).     ![Google Custom Search Engine layout]({{ '/assets/images/google-custom-search-engine-layout.png' | relative_url }})  3. Select \"Save & Get Code\" and grab your search engine ID from the line that begins with `var cx = 'YOUR_SEARCH_ENGINE_ID'`.  4. Add your search engine ID to `_config.yml` like so:     ```yaml    google:      search_engine_id: YOUR_SEARCH_ENGINE_ID    ```  **Note:** If your site is new and hasn't been indexed by Google yet, search will be incomplete and won't provide accurate results. {: .notice--info}  ### SEO, social sharing, and analytics settings  All optional, but a good idea to take the time setting up to improve SEO and links shared from the site.  #### Google Search Console  Formerly known as [Google Webmaster Tools](https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/), add your [verification code](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1142414?hl=en) like so: `google_site_verification: \"yourVerificationCode\"`.  **Note:** You likely won't have to do this if you verify site ownership through **Google Analytics** instead. {: .notice--warning}  #### Bing Webmaster Tools  There are several ways to [verify site ownership](https://www.bing.com/webmasters/help/add-and-verify-site-12184f8b) --- the easiest adding an authentication code to your config file.  Copy and paste the string inside of `content`:  ```html  ```  Into `_config.yml`  ```yaml bing_site_verification: \"0FC3FD70512616B052E755A56F8952D\" ```  #### Naver Webmaster Tools  To verify site ownership you will need to [create a Naver account](https://nid.naver.com/user2/joinGlobal.nhn?lang=en_US&m=init) and then **Add your site** via [Naver Webmaster Tools](http://webmastertool.naver.com/).  Much like Google and Bing you'll be provided with a meta description:  ```html ` ```  Which you can add to your `_config.yml` like so:  ```yaml naver_site_verification: \"6BF5A01C0E650B479B612AC5A2184144\" ```  #### Yandex  To verify site ownership copy and paste the string inside of `content`:  ```html  ```  Into `_config.yml`  ```yaml yandex_site_verification: \"2132801JL\" ```  #### Baidu  There are several ways to verify site ownership — the easiest is adding an authentication code to your config file.  Copy and paste the string inside of `content`:  ```html  ```  Into `_config.yml`  ```yaml baidu_site_verification: \"code-iA0wScWXN1\" ```  #### Twitter Cards and Facebook Open Graph  To improve the appearance of links shared from your site to social networks like Twitter and Facebook be sure to configure the following.  ##### Site Twitter username  Twitter username for the site. For pages that have custom author Twitter accounts assigned in their YAML Front Matter or data file, they will be attributed as a **creator** in the Twitter Card.  For example if my site's Twitter account is `@mmistakes-theme` I would add the following to `_config.yml`  ```yaml twitter:   username: \"mmistakes-theme\" ```  And if I assign `@mmistakes` as an author account it will appear in the Twitter Card along with `@mmistakes-theme`, attributed as a creator of the page being shared.  **Note**: You need to validate cards are working and have Twitter [approve Player Cards](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/tweets/optimize-with-cards/overview/player-card) before they will begin showing up. {: .notice--warning}  ##### Facebook Open Graph  If you have a Facebook ID or publisher page add them:  ```yaml facebook:   app_id:  # A Facebook app ID   publisher:  # A Facebook page URL or ID of the publishing entity ```  While not part a part of Open Graph, you can also add your Facebook username for use in the sidebar and footer.  ```yaml facebook:   username: \"michaelrose\"  # https://www.facebook.com/michaelrose ```  **ProTip:** To debug Open Graph data use [this tool](https://developers.facebook.com/tools/debug/) to test your pages. If content changes aren't reflected you will probably have to hit the **Scrape Again** button to refresh. {: .notice--info}  ##### Open Graph default image  For pages that don't have a `header.image` assigned in their YAML Front Matter, `site.og_image` will be used as a fallback. Use your logo, icon, avatar or something else that is meaningful. Just make sure it is placed in the `/assets/images/` folder, has a minimum size of 120px by 120px, and is less than 1MB in file size.  ```yaml og_image: /assets/images/site-logo.png ```        Example of a image placed in a Summary Card.   Documents who have a `header.image` assigned in their YAML Front Matter will appear like this when shared on Twitter and Facebook.        Shared page on Twitter with header image assigned.         Shared page on Facebook with header image assigned.   ##### Include your social profile in search results  Use markup on your official website to add your [social profile information](https://developers.google.com/structured-data/customize/social-profiles#adding_structured_markup_to_your_site) to the Google Knowledge panel in some searches. Knowledge panels can prominently display your social profile information.  ```yaml social:   type:  # Person or Organization (defaults to Person)   name:  # If the user or organization name differs from the site's name   links:     - \"https://twitter.com/yourTwitter\"     - \"https://www.facebook.com/yourFacebook\"     - \"https://instagram.com/yourProfile\"     - \"https://www.linkedin.com/in/yourprofile\" ```  #### Analytics  Analytics is disabled by default. To enable globally select one of the following:  | Name                 | Analytics Provider                                              | | -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- | | **google**           | [Google Standard Analytics](https://www.google.com/analytics/)  | | **google-universal** | [Google Universal Analytics](https://www.google.com/analytics/) | | **google-gtag**      | [Google Analytics Global Site Tag](https://www.google.com/analytics/) | | **custom**           | Other analytics providers                                       |  For Google Analytics add your Tracking Code:  ```yaml analytics:   provider: \"google-gtag\"   google:     tracking_id: \"UA-1234567-8\"     anonymize_ip: false # default ```  To use another provider not included with the theme set `provider: \"custom\"` then add their embed code to `_includes/analytics-providers/custom.html`.  **Note:** Analytics are disabled by default in `development`. To enable when testing/building locally be sure to set `JEKYLL_ENV=production` to [force the environment](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/configuration/#specifying-a-jekyll-environment-at-build-time) to production. {: .notice--info}  ## Site author  Used as the defaults for defining what appears in the author sidebar.  ![author sidebar example]({{ \"/assets/images/mm-author-sidebar-example.jpg\" | relative_url }})  **Note:** For sites with multiple authors these values can be overridden post by post with custom YAML Front Matter and a data file. For more information on how that works see below. {: .notice--info}  ```yaml author:   name     : \"Your Name\"   avatar   : \"/assets/images/bio-photo.jpg\"   bio      : \"My awesome biography constrained to a sentence or two goes here.\"   location : \"Somewhere, USA\" ```  Author links are all optional, include the ones you want visible under the `author.links` array.  | Name | Description | | --- | --- | | **label** | Link label (e.g. `\"Twitter\"`) | | **icon** | [Font Awesome icon](https://fontawesome.com/v5/search) classes (e.g. `\"fab fa-fw fa-twitter-square\"`) | | **url** | Link URL (e.g. `\"https://twitter.com/mmistakes\"`) |  ```yaml author:   name: \"Your Name\"   avatar: \"/assets/images/bio-photo.jpg\"   bio: \"I am an **amazing** person.\" # Note: Markdown is allowed   location: \"Somewhere\"   links:     - label: \"Made Mistakes\"       icon: \"fas fa-fw fa-link\"       url: \"https://mademistakes.com\"     - label: \"Twitter\"       icon: \"fab fa-fw fa-twitter-square\"       url: \"https://twitter.com/mmistakes\"     - label: \"GitHub\"       icon: \"fab fa-fw fa-github\"       url: \"https://github.com/mmistakes\"     - label: \"Instagram\"       icon: \"fab fa-fw fa-instagram\"       url: \"https://instagram.com/mmistakes\" ```  To customize the author sidebar, read the full [layout documentation]({{ \"/docs/layouts/#author-profile\" | relative_url }}).  ## Site footer  Footer links can be added under the `footer.links` array.  | Name | Description | | --- | --- | | **label** | Link label (e.g. `\"Twitter\"`) | | **icon** | [Font Awesome icon](https://fontawesome.com/v5/search) classes (e.g. `\"fab fa-fw fa-twitter-square\"`) | | **url** | Link URL (e.g. `\"https://twitter.com/mmistakes\"`) |  ```yaml footer:   links:     - label: \"Twitter\"       icon: \"fab fa-fw fa-twitter-square\"       url: \"https://twitter.com/mmistakes\"     - label: \"GitHub\"       icon: \"fab fa-fw fa-github\"       url: \"https://github.com/mmistakes\"     - label: \"Instagram\"       icon: \"fab fa-fw fa-instagram\"       url: \"https://instagram.com/mmistakes\" ```  **Note:** Twitter and Facebook footer links no longer automatically pull from `site.twitter.username` and `site.facebook.username`. This behavior has been deprecated in favor of the `footer.links` array above. {: .notice--danger}  To change \"Follow:\" text that precedes footer links, edit the `follow_label` key in `_data/ui-text.yml`.  ## Reading files  Nothing out of the ordinary here. `include` and `exclude` may be the only things you need to alter.  ## Conversion and Markdown processing  Again nothing out of the ordinary here as the theme adheres to the defaults used by GitHub Pages. [**Kramdown**](http://kramdown.gettalong.org/) for Markdown conversion, [**Rouge**](http://rouge.jneen.net/) syntax highlighting, and incremental building disabled. Change them if you need to.  ## Front Matter Defaults  To save yourself time setting [Front Matter Defaults](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/configuration/front-matter-defaults/) for posts, pages, and collections is the way to go. Sure you can assign layouts and toggle settings like **reading time**, **comments**, and **social sharing** in each file, but that's not ideal.  Using the `default` key in `_config.yml` you could set the layout and enable author profiles, reading time, comments, social sharing, and related posts for all posts --- in one shot.  ```yaml defaults:   # _posts   - scope:       path: \"\"       type: posts     values:       layout: single       author_profile: true       read_time: true       comments: true       share: true       related: true ```  Pages Front Matter defaults can be scoped like this:  ```yaml defaults:   # _pages   - scope:       path: \"\"       type: pages     values:       layout: single ```  And collections like this:  ```yaml defaults:   # _foo   - scope:       path: \"\"       type: foo     values:       layout: single ```  And of course any default value can be overridden by settings in a post, page, or collection file. All you need to do is specify the settings in the YAML Front Matter. For more examples be sure to check out the demo site's [`_config.yml`](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/blob/master/_config.yml).  ## Outputting  The default permalink style used by the theme is `permalink: /:categories/:title/`. If you have a post named `2016-01-01-my-post.md` with `categories: foo` in the YAML Front Matter, Jekyll will generate `_site/foo/my-post/index.html`.  **Note:** If you plan on enabling breadcrumb links --- including category names in permalinks is a big part of how those are created. {: .notice--warning}  ### Paginate  If [using pagination](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-paginate) on the homepage you can change the amount of posts shown with:  ```yaml paginate: 5 ```  You'll also need to include some Liquid and HTML to properly use the paginator, which you can find in the **Layouts** section under [Home Page]({{ \"/docs/layouts/#home-page\" | relative_url }}).  The paginator only works on files with name `index.html`. To use pagination in a subfolder --- for example `/recent/`, create `/recent/index.html` and set the `paginate_path` in `_config.yml` to this:  ```yaml paginate_path: /recent/page:num/ ```  **Please note:** When using Jekyll's default [pagination plugin](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/pagination/) `paginator.posts` can only be called once. If you're looking for something more powerful that can paginate category, tag, and collection pages I suggest [**jekyll-paginate-v2**](https://github.com/sverrirs/jekyll-paginate-v2). {: .notice--info}  ### Timezone  This sets the timezone environment variable, which Ruby uses to handle time and date creation and manipulation. Any entry from the [IANA Time Zone Database](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones) is valid. The default is the local time zone, as set by your operating system.  ```yaml timezone: America/New_York ```  ## Plugins  When hosting with GitHub Pages a small [set of gems](https://pages.github.com/versions/) have been whitelisted for use. The theme uses a few of them which can be found under `gems`. Additional settings and configurations are documented in the links below.  | Plugin | Description                                                                               | | --- | --- | | [jekyll-paginate][jekyll-paginate] | Pagination Generator for Jekyll. | | [jekyll-sitemap][jekyll-sitemap] | Jekyll plugin to silently generate a sitemaps.org compliant sitemap for your Jekyll site. | | [jekyll-gist][jekyll-gist] | Liquid tag for displaying GitHub Gists in Jekyll sites. | | [jekyll-feed][jekyll-feed] | A Jekyll plugin to generate an Atom (RSS-like) feed of your Jekyll posts. | | [jekyll-include-cache][jekyll-include-cache] | Liquid tag that caches Liquid includes. |  [jekyll-paginate]: https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-paginate [jekyll-sitemap]: https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-sitemap [jekyll-gist]: https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-gist [jekyll-feed]: https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-feed [jekyll-include-cache]: https://github.com/benbalter/jekyll-include-cache  If you're hosting elsewhere then you don't really have to worry about what is whitelisted as you are free to include whatever [Jekyll plugins](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/plugins/) you desire.  **Note:** The [jekyll-include-cache](https://github.com/benbalter/jekyll-include-cache) plugin needs to be installed in your `Gemfile` and added to the `plugins` array of `_config.yml`. Otherwise you'll throw `Unknown tag 'include_cached'` errors at build. {: .notice--warning}  ## Archive settings  The theme ships with support for taxonomy (category and tag) pages. GitHub Pages hosted sites need to use a _Liquid only_ approach while those hosted elsewhere can use plugins like [**jekyll-archives**][jekyll-archives] to generate these pages automatically.  [jekyll-archives]: https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-archives  The default `type` is set to use Liquid.  **Note:** `category_archive` and `tag_archive` were previously named `categories` and `tags`. Names were changed to avoid possible conflicts with `site.categories` and `site.tags`. {: .notice--danger}  ```yaml category_archive:   type: liquid   path: /categories/ tag_archive:   type: liquid   path: /tags/ ```  Which would create category and tag links in the breadcrumbs and page meta like: `/categories/#foo` and `/tags/#foo`.  **Note:** these are simply hash (fragment) links into the full taxonomy index pages. For them to resolve properly, the category and tag index pages need to exist at [`/categories/index.html`](https://github.com/{{ site.repository }}/blob/master/docs/_pages/category-archive.md) (copy to `_pages/category-archive.md`) and [`/tags/index.html`](https://github.com/{{ site.repository }}/blob/master/docs/_pages/tag-archive.md) (copy to `_pages/tag-archive.md`). {: .notice--warning}  If you have the luxury of using Jekyll Plugins, then [**jekyll-archives**][jekyll-archives] will create a better experience as discrete taxonomy pages would be generated, and their corresponding links would be \"real\" (not just hash/fragment links into a larger index). However, the plugin will not generate the taxonomy index pages (`category-archive.md` and `tag-archive.md`) so you'd still need to manually create them if you'd like to have them (see note above).  First, you'll need to make sure that the `jekyll-archives` plugin is installed. Either run `gem install jekyll-archives` or add the following to your `Gemfile`:  ``` group :jekyll_plugins do   gem \"jekyll-archives\" end ```  Then run `bundle install`.  Now that the plugin is installed, change `type` to `jekyll-archives` and apply the following [configurations](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-archives/blob/master/docs/configuration.md):  ```yaml category_archive:   type: jekyll-archives   path: /categories/ tag_archive:   type: jekyll-archives   path: /tags/ jekyll-archives:   enabled:     - categories     - tags   layouts:     category: archive-taxonomy     tag: archive-taxonomy   permalinks:     category: /categories/:name/     tag: /tags/:name/ ```  **Note:** The `archive-taxonomy` layout used by jekyll-archives is provided with the theme and can be found in the `_layouts` folder. {: .notice--info}     Tip   To apply [Front Matter defaults](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/configuration/front-matter-defaults/) to pages generated by the `jekyll-archives` plugin, you can specify a scope of an empty `path` and a `type` of either `tag` or `category`.  For example, the following configuration enables author profile on tag archives and disables comments on category archives.  ```yaml defaults:   - scope:       path: \"\"       type: tag     values:       author_profile: true   - scope:       path: \"\"       type: category     values:       comments: false ```    ## HTML compression  If you care at all about performance (and really who doesn't) compressing the HTML files generated by Jekyll is a good thing to do.  If you're hosting with GitHub Pages there aren't many options afforded to you for optimizing the HTML Jekyll generates. Thankfully there is some Liquid wizardry you can use to strip whitespace and comments to reduce file size.  There's a variety of configurations and caveats to using the `compress` layout, so be sure to read through the [documentation](http://jch.penibelst.de/) if you decide to make change the defaults set in the theme's `_config.yml`.  ```yaml compress_html:   clippings: all   ignore:     envs: development  # disable compression in dev environment ```  **Caution:** Inline JavaScript comments can cause problems with `compress.html`, so be sure to `/* comment this way */` and avoid `// these sorts of comments`. {: .notice--warning}  **Note:** CDN services such as CloudFlare provide optional automatic minification for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. If you are serving your site via such a service and have minification enabled, this configuration might be redundant. {: .notice--info} ","categories": [],

For example, if you wanted to modify the default [`single` layout](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/blob/master/_layouts/single.html), you'd start by copying it to `_layouts/single.html`.  **ProTip**: To locate theme files, run `bundle info minimal-mistakes-jekyll`.

There's not much to this layout apart from pulling in several `_includes`:  * `` elements * masthead navigation links * {% raw %}`{{ content }}`{% endraw %} * page footer * scripts  **Note:** You won't ever assign this layout directly to a post or page. Instead all other layouts will build off of it by setting `layout: default` in their YAML Front Matter. {: .notice--warning}  ### Layout based and user-defined classes  Class names corresponding to each layout are automatically added to the `` element eg. ``.  | layout           | class name                  | | ---------------- | --------------------------- | | archive          | `.layout--archive`          | | archive-taxonomy | `.layout--archive-taxonomy` | | search           | `.layout--search`           | | single           | `.layout--single`           | | splash           | `.layout--splash`           | | home             | `.layout--home`             | | posts            | `.layout--posts`            | | categories       | `.layout--categories`       | | category         | `.layout--category`         | | tags             | `.layout--tags`             | | tag              | `.layout--tag`              |  Using YAML Front Matter you can also assign custom classes to target with CSS or JavaScript. Perfect for \"art directed\" posts or adding custom styles to specific pages.  Example:  ```yaml --- layout: splash classes:   - landing   - dark-theme --- ```  Outputs:  ```html  ```  ### Canonical URL  You can set custom Canonical URL for a page by specifying `canonical_url` option in pages YAML Front Matter. For example, if you have the following:  ```yaml layout: single title: Title of Your Post canonical_url: \"https://yoursite.com/custom-canonical-url\" ```  This will generate the following in the `` of your page:  ```html  ```  ## Compress layout  A Jekyll layout that compresses HTML in pure Liquid. To enable add `layout: compress` to `_layouts/default.html`.  **Note:** Has been known to mangle markup and break JavaScript... especially if inline `// comments` are present. For this reason it has been disabled by default. {: .notice--danger}  * [Documentation](http://jch.penibelst.de/)  ## Single layout  The layout you'll likely use the most --- sidebar and main content combo.  **Includes:**  * Optional header image with caption * Optional header overlay (solid color/image) + text and optional \"call to action\" button * Optional social sharing links module * Optional comments module * Optional related posts module * Wide page variant  {% include gallery id=\"single_layout_gallery\" caption=\"Image header and meta info examples for `single` layout\" %}  Assign with `layout: single` , or better yet apply as a [Front Matter default]({{ \"/docs/configuration/#front-matter-defaults\" | relative_url }}) in `_config.yml`.  ### Wide page  To expand the main content to the right, filling the space of what is normally occupied by the table of contents. Add the following to a post or page's YAML Front Matter:  ```yaml classes: wide ```  **Note:** If the page contains a table of contents, it will no longer appear to the right. Instead it will be forced into the main content container directly following the page's title. {: .notice--info}  ### Table of contents  Auto-generated table of contents list for your posts and pages can be enabled by adding `toc: true` to the YAML Front Matter.  ![table of contents example]({{ \"/assets/images/mm-toc-helper-example.jpg\" | relative_url }})  | Parameter   | Required | Description | Default | | ---------   | -------- | ----------- | ------- | | **toc**     | Optional | Show table of contents. (boolean) | `false` | | **toc_label** | Optional | Table of contents title. (string) | `toc_label` in UI Text data file. | | **toc_icon**  | Optional | Table of contents icon, displays before the title. (string) | [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/v5/search?s=solid&m=free)  **file-alt** icon. Other FA icons can be used instead. | | **toc_sticky** | Optional | Stick table of contents to top of screen.                   | `false` |  **TOC example with custom title and icon**  ```yaml --- toc: true toc_label: \"My Table of Contents\" toc_icon: \"cog\" --- ```  {% capture notice-text %} **Note:** You need to use contiguous levels of headings for the TOC to generate properly. For example:  ```markdown Good headings:  # Heading ## Heading ### Heading ### Heading # Heading ## Heading  Bad headings:  # Heading ### Heading (skipped H2) ##### Heading (skipped H4) ``` {% endcapture %}     {{ notice-text | markdownify }}   ## Archive layout  Essentially the same as `single` with markup adjustments and some modules removed.  **Includes:**  * Optional header image with caption * Optional header overlay (solid color/image) + text and optional \"call to action\" button * List and grid views        List view example.   Below are sample archive pages you can easily drop into your project, taking care to rename `permalink`, `title`, or the filename to fit your site. Each is 100% compatible with GitHub Pages.  * [All Posts Grouped by Category -- List View][posts-categories] * [All Posts Grouped by Tag -- List View][posts-tags] * [All Posts Grouped by Year -- List View][posts-year] * [All Posts Grouped by Collection -- List View][posts-collection] * [Portfolio Collection -- Grid View][portfolio-collection]  [posts-categories]: https://github.com/{{ site.repository }}/blob/master/docs/_pages/category-archive.md [posts-tags]: https://github.com/{{ site.repository }}/blob/master/docs/_pages/tag-archive.md [posts-year]: https://github.com/{{ site.repository }}/blob/master/docs/_pages/year-archive.md [posts-collection]: https://github.com/{{ site.repository }}/blob/master/docs/_pages/collection-archive.html [portfolio-collection]: https://github.com/{{ site.repository }}/blob/master/docs/_pages/portfolio-archive.md  Post and page excerpts are auto-generated by Jekyll which grabs the first paragraph of text. To override this text with something more specific use the following YAML Front Matter:  ```yaml excerpt: \"A unique line of text to describe this post that will display in an archive listing and meta description with SEO benefits.\" ```  ### Wide page  To expand the main content to the right, filling the space of what is normally occupied by the table of contents. Add the following to a post or page's YAML Front Matter:  ```yaml classes: wide ```  ### Grid view  Adding `type=grid` to the `archive-single` helper will display archive posts in a 4 column grid. For example to create an archive displaying all documents in the portfolio collection:  Create a portfolio archive page (eg. `_pages/portfolio-archive.md`) with the following YAML Front Matter:  ```yaml --- title: Portfolio layout: collection permalink: /portfolio/ collection: portfolio entries_layout: grid --- ```  Teaser images are assigned similar to header images using the following YAML Front Matter:  ```yaml header:   teaser: path-to-teaser-image.jpg ```  **Note:** More information on using this `_include` can be found under [**Helpers**]({{ \"/docs/helpers/\" | relative_url }}). {: .notice--info}  ## Taxonomy archives  If you have the luxury of using Jekyll plugins, the creation of category and tag archives is greatly simplified. Simply enable support for the [`jekyll-archives`](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-archives) plugin with a few `_config.yml` settings as noted in the [**Configuration**]({{ \"/docs/configuration/#archive-settings\" | relative_url }}) section and you're good to go.  ![archive taxonomy layout example]({{ \"/assets/images/mm-layout-archive-taxonomy.png\" | relative_url }})  If you're not using the `jekyll-archives` plugin then you need to create archive pages yourself. Sample taxonomy archives can be found by grabbing the Markdown sources below and adding to your site.  | Name                 | Layout | Example | | -------------------- | ------ | ------ | | [Posts Archive](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/year-archive/) | `layout: posts` | [year-archive.md](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/blob/master/docs/_pages/year-archive.md) | | [Categories Archive](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/categories/) | `layout: categories` | [category-archive.md](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/blob/master/docs/_pages/category-archive.md) | | [Category Archive](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/categories/edge-case/) | `layout: category` | [edge-case.md](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/blob/master/docs/_pages/edge-case.md) | | [Tags Archive](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/tags/) | `layout: tags` | [tag-archive.md](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/blob/master/docs/_pages/tag-archive.md) | | [Tag Archive](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/tags/markup/) | `layout: tag` | [markup.md](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/blob/master/docs/_pages/markup.md) | | [Collection Archive](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/recipes/) | `layout: collection` | [recipes-archive.md](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/blob/master/docs/_pages/recipes-archive.md) |  **Note:** By default, documents are shown in a list view. To change to a grid view add `entries_layout: grid` to the page's front matter. {: .notice--info}  ### `layout: posts`  This layout displays all posts grouped by the year they were published. It accommodates the same front matter as `layout: archive`.  ### `layout: categories`  This layout displays all posts grouped category. It accommodates the same front matter as `layout: archive`.  ### `layout: tags`  This layout displays all posts grouped by tag. It accommodates the same front matter as `layout: archive`.  ### `layout: collection`  This layout displays all documents grouped by a specific collection. It accommodates the same front matter as `layout: archive` with the addition of the following:  ```yaml collection: # collection name entries_layout: # list (default), grid show_excerpts: # true (default), false sort_by: # date (default), title or any metadata key added to the collection's documents sort_order: # forward (default), reverse ```  To create a page showing all documents in the `recipes` collection you'd create `recipes.md` in the root of your project and add this front matter:  ```yaml title: Recipes layout: collection permalink: /recipes/ collection: recipes ```  If you want to sort the collection by title add `sort_by: title`. If you want reverse sorting, add `sort_order: reverse`. You can also use any metadata key that is present in the documents. For example, you can add `number: ` to your documents and use `number` as the sort key:  ```yaml sort_by: number ```  ### `layout: category`  This layout displays all posts grouped by a specific category. It accommodates the same front matter as `layout: archive` with the addition of the following:  ```yaml taxonomy: # category name entries_layout: # list (default), grid ```  To create a page showing all posts assigned to the category `foo` you'd create `foo.md` and add this front matter:  ```yaml title: Foo layout: category permalink: /categories/foo/ taxonomy: foo ```  ### `layout: tag`  This layout displays all posts grouped by a specific tag. It accommodates the same front matter as `layout: archive` with the addition of the following:  ```yaml taxonomy: # tag name entries_layout: # list (default), grid ```  To create a page showing all posts assigned to the tag `foo bar` you'd create `foo-bar.md` and add this front matter:  ```yaml title: Foo Bar layout: tag permalink: /tags/foo-bar/ taxonomy: foo bar ```  ## Home page layout  A derivative archive page layout to be used as a simple home page. It is built to show a paginated list of recent posts based off of the [pagination settings]({{ \"/docs/configuration/#paginate\" | relative_url }}) in `_config.yml`.        Example of a paginated home page showing 5 recent posts.   To use create `index.html` at the root of your project and add the following YAML Front Matter:  ```yaml --- layout: home --- ```  Then configure pagination in `_config.yml`.  ```yaml paginate: 5 # amount of posts to show paginate_path: /page:num/ ```  If you'd rather have a paginated page of posts reside in a subfolder instead of acting as your homepage make the following adjustments.  Create `index.html` in the location you'd like. For example if I wanted it to live at **/blog** I'd create `/blog/index.html` with `layout: home` in its YAML Front Matter.  Then adjust the `paginate_path` in **_config.yml** to match.  ```yaml paginate_path: /blog/page:num ```  **Note:** Jekyll can only paginate a single `index.html` file. If you'd like to paginate more pages (e.g. category indexes) you'll need the help of a custom plugin. For more pagination related settings check the [**Configuration**]({{ \"/docs/configuration/#paginate\" | relative_url }}) section. {: .notice--info}  **Note:** By default, documents are shown in a list view. To change to a grid view add `entries_layout: grid` to the page's front matter. To increase the width of the main container, giving more space to the grid items also add `classes: wide` to the home page's YAML Front Matter. {: .notice--info}  ## Splash page layout  For full-width landing pages that need a little something extra add `layout: splash` to the YAML Front Matter.  **Includes:**  * Optional header image with caption * Optional header overlay (solid color/image) + text and optional \"call to action\" button * Feature blocks (`left`, `center`, and `right` alignment options)  ![splash page layout example]({{ \"/assets/images/mm-layout-splash.png\" | relative_url }})  Feature blocks can be assigned and aligned to the `left`, `right`, or `center` with a sprinkling of YAML. For full details on how to use the `feature_row` helper check the [**Content**]({{ \"/docs/helpers/\" | relative_url }}) section or review a [sample splash page](https://github.com/{{ site.repository }}/blob/master/docs/_pages/splash-page.md).  ## Search page layout  A page with a search form. Add `layout: search` to the YAML Front Matter similar to [this example](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/blob/master/test/_pages/search.md) on the test site.  ![search page layout example]({{ \"/assets/images/search-layout-example.png\" | relative_url }})  **Note:** A page using the `layout: search` isn't compatible with the new [site search feature]({{ \"/docs/configuration/#site-search\" | relative_url }}) incorporated in the masthead. {: .notice--warning}  ### Exclusions  If you would like to exclude specific pages/posts from the search index set the search flag to `false` in the YAML Front Matter for the page/post.  ```yaml search: false ```  **ProTip:** Add a link to this page in the masthead navigation. {: .notice--info}  ---  ## Headers  To add some visual punch to a post or page, a large full-width header image can be included.  Be sure to resize your header images. `~1280px` is a good width if you aren't [responsively serving up images](http://alistapart.com/article/responsive-images-in-practice). Through the magic of CSS they will scale up or down to fill the container. If you go with something too small it will look like garbage when upscaled, and something too large will hurt performance.  **Please Note:** Paths for image headers, overlays, teasers, [galleries]({{ \"/docs/helpers/#gallery\" | relative_url }}), and [feature rows]({{ \"/docs/helpers/#feature-row\" | relative_url }}) have changed and require a full path. Instead of just `image: filename.jpg` you'll need to use the full path eg: `image: /assets/images/filename.jpg`. The preferred location is now `/assets/images/`, but can be placed elsewhere or external hosted. This all applies for image references in `_config.yml` and `author.yml` as well. {: .notice--danger}  ![single layout header image example]({{ \"/assets/images/mm-single-header-example.jpg\" | relative_url }})  Place your images in the `/assets/images/` folder and add the following YAML Front Matter:  ```yaml header:   image: /assets/images/image-filename.jpg ```  For externally hosted images include the full image path instead of just the filename:  ```yaml header:   image: http://some-site.com/assets/images/image.jpg ```  To provide a custom alt tag for screen readers:  ```yaml header:   image: /assets/images/unsplash-image-1.jpg   image_description: \"A description of the image\" ```  To include a caption or attribution for the image:  ```yaml header:   image: /assets/images/unsplash-image-1.jpg   caption: \"Photo credit: [**Unsplash**](https://unsplash.com)\" ```  **ProTip:** Captions written in Markdown are supported, so feel free to add links, or style text. Just be sure to wrap it in quotes. {: .notice--info}  ### Header overlay  To overlay text on top of a header image you have a few more options:  | Name                     | Description | Default | | ----                     | ----------- | ------- | | **overlay_image**        | Header image you'd like to overlay. Same rules as `header.image` from above. | | | **overlay_filter**       | Color/opacity to overlay on top of the header image. Example: `0.5`, `rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.5)` or [`linear-gradient`][mdn-linear-gradient]. | | **show_overlay_excerpt** | Display excerpt in the overlay text | true | | **excerpt**              | Auto-generated page excerpt is added to the overlay text or can be overridden. | | | **tagline**              | Overrides page excerpt. Useful when header text needs to be different from excerpt in archive views. | | | **actions**              | Call to action button links (`actions` array: `label` and `url`). More than one button link can be assigned. | | | **cta_label**            | Deprecated, use `actions` instead. Call to action button text label. | `more_label` in UI Text data file | | **cta_url**              | Deprecated, use `actions` instead. Call to action button URL. | |    [mdn-linear-gradient]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/linear-gradient()  With this YAML Front Matter:  ```yaml excerpt: \"This post should display a **header with an overlay image**, if the theme supports it.\" header:   overlay_image: /assets/images/unsplash-image-1.jpg   caption: \"Photo credit: [**Unsplash**](https://unsplash.com)\"   actions:     - label: \"More Info\"       url: \"https://unsplash.com\" ```  You'd get a header image overlaid with text and a call to action button like this:  ![single layout header overlay example]({{ \"/assets/images/mm-single-header-overlay-example.jpg\" | relative_url }})  You also have the option of specifying a solid background-color to use instead of an image.  ![single layout header overlay with background fill]({{ \"/assets/images/mm-single-header-overlay-fill-example.jpg\" | relative_url }})  ```yaml excerpt: \"This post should display a **header with a solid background color**, if the theme supports it.\" header:   overlay_color: \"#333\" ```  You can also specifying the opacity (between `0` and `1`) of a black overlay like so:  ![transparent black overlay]({{ \"/assets/images/mm-header-overlay-black-filter.jpg\" | relative_url }})  ```yaml excerpt: \"This post should [...]\" header:   overlay_image: /assets/images/unsplash-image-1.jpg   overlay_filter: 0.5 # same as adding an opacity of 0.5 to a black background   caption: \"Photo credit: [**Unsplash**](https://unsplash.com)\"   actions:     - label: \"Download\"       url: \"https://github.com\" ```  Or if you feel colorful, use full rgba:  ![transparent red overlay]({{ \"/assets/images/mm-header-overlay-red-filter.jpg\" | relative_url }})  ```yaml excerpt: \"This post should [...]\" header:   overlay_image: /assets/images/unsplash-image-1.jpg   overlay_filter: rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.5)   caption: \"Photo credit: [**Unsplash**](https://unsplash.com)\"   actions:     - label: \"Download\"       url: \"https://github.com\" ```  Or if you want to do more fancy things, go all the way to [linear-gradient][mdn-linear-gradient]:  ![transparent custom overlay]({{ \"/assets/images/mm-header-overlay-custom-filter.jpg\" | relative_url }})  ```yaml excerpt: \"This post should [...]\" header:   overlay_image: /assets/images/unsplash-image-1.jpg   overlay_filter: linear-gradient(rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.5), rgba(0, 255, 255, 0.5))   caption: \"Photo credit: [**Unsplash**](https://unsplash.com)\"   actions:     - label: \"Download\"       url: \"https://github.com\" ```  Multiple call to action button links can be assigned like this:  ```yaml excerpt: \"This post should display a **header with an overlay image**, if the theme supports it.\" header:   overlay_image: /assets/images/unsplash-image-1.jpg   caption: \"Photo credit: [**Unsplash**](https://unsplash.com)\"   actions:     - label: \"Foo Button\"       url: \"#foo\"     - label: \"Bar Button\"       url: \"#bar\" ```  ### Open Graph & Twitter Card images  By default the large page header or overlay images are used for sharing previews. If you'd like to set this image to something else use `page.header.og_image` like:  ```yaml header:   image: /assets/images/your-page-image.jpg   og_image: /assets/images/your-og-image.jpg ```  **ProTip:** `og_image` is useful for setting OpenGraph images on pages that don't have a header or overlay image. {: .notice--info}  ---  ## Sidebars  The space to the left of a page's main content is blank by default, but has the ability to show an author profile (name, short biography, social media links), custom content, or both.  ### Author profile  Add `author_profile: true` to a post or page's YAML Front Matter.  ![single layout example]({{ \"/assets/images/mm-layout-single.png\" | relative_url }})  Better yet, enable it with Front Matter Defaults set in `_config.yml`.  ```yaml defaults:   # _posts   - scope:       path: \"\"       type: posts     values:       author_profile: true ```  **Note:** To disable the author sidebar profile for a specific post or page, add `author_profile: false` to the YAML Front Matter instead. {: .notice--warning}  To assign more author links, add to the `author.links` array  in [`_config.yml`]({{ \"/docs/configuration/\" | relative_url }}) link so. Any of [Font Awesome's icons](https://fontawesome.com/v5/search) are available for use.  ```yaml author:   name: \"Your Name\"   avatar: \"/assets/images/bio-photo.jpg\"   bio: \"I am an **amazing** person.\" # Note: Markdown is allowed   location: \"Somewhere\"   links:     - label: \"Made Mistakes\"       icon: \"fas fa-fw fa-link\"       url: \"https://mademistakes.com\"     - label: \"Twitter\"       icon: \"fab fa-fw fa-twitter-square\"       url: \"https://twitter.com/mmistakes\"     - label: \"GitHub\"       icon: \"fab fa-fw fa-github\"       url: \"https://github.com/mmistakes\"     - label: \"Instagram\"       icon: \"fab fa-fw fa-instagram\"       url: \"https://instagram.com/mmistakes\" ```  **Note:** Depending on the icon and theme skin used, colors may not be used. Popular social networks like Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, etc. have the appropriate brand color set in CSS. To change or add missing colors edit [`_utilities.scss`](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/blob/master/_sass/minimal-mistakes/_utilities.scss) in `/_sass/minimal-mistakes/`. {: .notice--info}  For example, to color a Reddit icon, simply add a `color` declaration and the corresponding hex code like so:  ```scss .social-icons {   .fa-reddit {     color: #ff4500;   } } ```  ![Reddit link in author profile with color]({{ \"/assets/images/mm-author-profile-reddit-color.png\" | relative_url }})  ### Custom sidebar content  Blocks of content can be added by using the following under `sidebar`:  | Name          | Description                                                | | ----          | -----------                                                | | **title**     | Title or heading.                                          | | **image**     | Image path placed in `/images/` folder or an external URL. | | **image_alt** | Alternate description for image.                           | | **text**      | Text. Markdown is allowed.                                 |  Multiple blocks can also be added by following the example below:  ```yaml sidebar:   - title: \"Title\"     image: http://placehold.it/350x250     image_alt: \"image\"     text: \"Some text here.\"   - title: \"Another Title\"     text: \"More text here.\" ```        Example of custom sidebar content added as YAML Front Matter.   **Note:** Custom sidebar content added to a post or page's YAML Front Matter will appear below the author profile if enabled with `author_profile: true`. {: .notice--info}  ### Custom sidebar navigation menu  To create a sidebar menu[^sidebar-menu] similar to the one found in the theme's documentation pages you'll need to modify a `_data` file and some YAML Front Matter.  [^sidebar-menu]: Sidebar menu supports 1 level of nested links.        Custom sidebar navigation menu example.   To start, add a new key to `_data/navigation.yml`. This will be referenced later via YAML Front Matter so keep it short and memorable. In the case of the theme's documentation menu I used `docs`.  **Sample sidebar menu links:**  ```yaml docs:   - title: Getting Started     children:       - title: \"Quick-Start Guide\"         url: /docs/quick-start-guide/       - title: \"Structure\"         url: /docs/structure/       - title: \"Installation\"         url: /docs/installation/       - title: \"Upgrading\"         url: /docs/upgrading/    - title: Customization     children:       - title: \"Configuration\"         url: /docs/configuration/       - title: \"Navigation\"         url: /docs/navigation/       - title: \"UI Text\"         url: /docs/ui-text/       - title: \"Authors\"         url: /docs/authors/       - title: \"Layouts\"         url: /docs/layouts/    - title: Content     children:       - title: \"Working with Posts\"         url: /docs/posts/       - title: \"Working with Pages\"         url: /docs/pages/       - title: \"Working with Collections\"         url: /docs/collections/       - title: \"Helpers\"         url: /docs/helpers/       - title: \"Utility Classes\"         url: /docs/utility-classes/    - title: Extras     children:       - title: \"Stylesheets\"         url: /docs/stylesheets/       - title: \"JavaScript\"         url: /docs/javascript/ ```  Now you can pull these links into any page by adding the following YAML Front Matter.  ```yaml sidebar:   nav: \"docs\" ```  **Note:** `nav: \"docs\"` references the `docs` key in `_data/navigation.yml` so make sure they match. {: .notice--info}  If you're adding a sidebar navigation menu to several pages the use of Front Matter Defaults is a better option. You can define them in `_config.yml` to avoid adding it to every page or post.  **Sample sidebar nav default:**  ```yaml defaults:   # _docs   - scope:       path: \"\"       type: docs     values:       sidebar:         nav: \"docs\" ```  ---  ## Social sharing links  The `single` layout has an option to enable social links at the bottom of posts for sharing on Twitter, Facebook, and LinkedIn. Similar to the links found in the author sidebar, the theme ships with defaults for the most common social networks.  ![default social share link buttons]({{ \"/assets/images/mm-social-share-links-default.png\" | relative_url }})  To enable these links add `share: true` to a post or page's YAML Front Matter or use a [default](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/configuration/#front-matter-defaults) in your `_config.yml` to apply more globally.  If you'd like to add, remove, or change the order of these default links you can do so by editing [`_includes/social-share.html`](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/blob/master/_includes/social-share.html).  Let's say you wanted to replace the LinkedIn button with a Reddit one. Simply replace the HTML with the following:  ```html {% raw %} Reddit{% endraw %} ```  The important parts to change are:  1. Share point URL *eg. `https://www.reddit.com/submit?url=` 2. Link `title` 3. [Font Awesome icon](http://fontawesome.io/icons/) (`fa-` class) 4. Link label  ![Reddit social share link button]({{ \"/assets/images/mm-social-share-links-reddit-gs.png\" | relative_url }})  To change the color of the button use one of the built in [utility classes]({{ \"/docs/utility-classes/#buttons\" | relative_url }}). Or you can create a new button class to match whatever color you want.  Under the `$social` color map in `assets/_scss/_buttons.scss` simply add a name (this will be appened to `btn--`) that matches the new button class. In our case `reddit` ~> `.btn--reddit`.  ```scss $social: (facebook, $facebook-color), (twitter, $twitter-color), (linkedin, $linkedin-color), (reddit, #ff4500); ```  **ProTip:** For bonus points you can add it as a Sass `$variable` that you set in `_variables.scss` like the other [\"brand\" colors](http://brandcolors.net/). {: .notice--info}  Add the new `.btn--reddit` class to the `` element from earlier, [compile `main.css`]({{ \"/docs/stylesheets/\" | relative_url }}) and away you go.  ```html {% raw %} Reddit{% endraw %} ```  ![Reddit social share link button]({{ \"/assets/images/mm-social-share-links-reddit-color.png\" | relative_url }})  ---  ## Custom head and footer  The `default` layout includes a number of custom templates, which provide ways for you to directly add content to all your pages.  ### Head  `_includes/head/custom.html` is included at the end of the `` tag. An example use of this include is to add custom CSS per page:  Add some Liquid tags for the new configuration to `_includes/head/custom.html`. {% raw %}```html {% if page.page_css %}   {% for stylesheet in page.page_css %}        {% endfor %} {% endif %} ```{% endraw %}  Next, add `page_css` to any page's YAML Front Matter to have your CSS loaded for that page. ```yaml page_css:   - /path/to/your/custom.css ```  ### Footer  `_includes/footer/custom.html` is included at the beginning of the `` tag. An example use of this include is to add custom JavaScript per page:  Add some Liquid tags for the new configuration to `_includes/footer/custom.html`. {% raw %}```html {% if page.page_js %}   {% for script in page.page_js %}        {% endfor %} {% endif %} ```{% endraw %}  Next, add `page_js` to any page's YAML Front Matter to have your JavaScript loaded for that page. ```yaml page_js:   - /path/to/your/custom.js ```  --- ","categories": [],

        "excerpt":"To better organize all of your pages you can centralize them into a single location similar to posts and collections.  **Step 1:** Start by placing pages (`.md` or `.html` files) into a `_pages` directory. Meaningfully naming files should be the goal. Avoid patterns like `/about/index.md` as it makes distinguishing between multiple `index.md` files harder.  ```bash sample-project └── _pages/     ├── 404.md               # custom 404 page     ├── about.md             # about page     └── contact.md           # contact page ```  **Step 2:** Include pages to be sure Jekyll \"sees\" and processes the files inside of `_pages`. Add `include: [\"_pages\"]` to `_config.yml`.  **Step 3:** Assign permalink overrides in the YAML Front Matter of each.  Examples:  | filename            | permalink              | | --------            | ---------              | | _pages/about.md     | `permalink: /about/`   | | _pages/home.md      | `permalink: /`         | | _pages/contact.md   | `permalink: /contact/` |  **Recommended Front Matter Defaults:**  ```yaml defaults:   # _pages   - scope:       path: \"\"       type: pages     values:       layout: single       author_profile: true ```","categories": [],

Let's quickly walk through the steps to do that.  **Step 1:** Configure the portfolio collection by adding the following to `_config.yml`.  ```yaml collections:   portfolio:     output: true     permalink: /:collection/:path/ ```  These settings essentially say output `index.html` files for each portfolio document in `_portfolio` at `_site/portfolio//`.  Just like posts and pages you'll probably want to set some defaults for the Front Matter:  ```yaml defaults:   # _portfolio   - scope:       path: \"\"       type: portfolio     values:       layout: single       author_profile: false       share: true ```  Now make a portfolio.md file in the '_pages' folder.  ```yaml --- title: Portfolio layout: collection permalink: /portfolio/ collection: portfolio entries_layout: grid classes: wide --- ```  And then create portfolio content like [`_portfolio/foo-bar-website.md`](https://github.com/{{ site.repository }}/blob/master/docs/_portfolio/foo-bar-website.md), to end up with something like this.  ![portfolio collection example]({{ \"/assets/images/mm-portfolio-collection-example.jpg\" | relative_url }}) ","categories": [],

        "excerpt":"The theme's `assets/css/main.css` file is built from several SCSS partials located in [`_sass/`](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/tree/master/_sass) and is structured as follows:  ```bash minimal-mistakes ├── _sass |  └── minimal-mistakes |     ├── vendor               # vendor SCSS partials |     |   ├── breakpoint       # media query mixins |     |   ├── magnific-popup   # Magnific Popup lightbox |     |   └── susy             # Susy grid system |     ├── _animations.scss     # animations |     ├── _archive.scss        # archives (list, grid, feature views) |     ├── _base.scss           # base HTML elements |     ├── _buttons.scss        # buttons |     ├── _footer.scss         # footer |     ├── _masthead.scss       # masthead |     ├── _mixins.scss         # mixins (em function, clearfix) |     ├── _navigation.scss     # nav links (breadcrumb, priority+, toc, pagination, etc.) |     ├── _notices.scss        # notices |     ├── _page.scss           # pages |     ├── _print.scss          # print styles |     ├── _reset.scss          # reset |     ├── _sidebar.scss        # sidebar |     ├── _syntax.scss         # syntax highlighting |     ├── _tables.scss         # tables |     ├── _utilities.scss      # utility classes (text/image alignment) |     └── _variables.scss      # theme defaults (fonts, colors, etc.) ├── assets |  ├── css |  |  └── main.scss            # main stylesheet, loads SCSS partials in _sass ```  ## Customizing  To override the default [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/guide) (located in theme's `_sass` directory), do one of the following:  1. Copy directly from the Minimal Mistakes theme gem     - Go to your local Minimal Mistakes gem installation directory (run      `bundle show minimal-mistakes-jekyll` to get the path to it).    - Copy the contents of `/assets/css/main.scss` from there to      ``.    - Customize what you want inside `/assets/css/main.scss`.  2. Copy from this repo.     - Copy the contents of [assets/css/main.scss](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/blob/master/assets/css/main.scss)      to ``.    - Customize what you want inside `` due to the way Jekyll currently reads those files.  To make basic tweaks to theme's style Sass variables can be overridden by adding to `/assets/css/main.scss`. For instance, to change the link color used throughout the theme add:  ```scss $link-color: red; ```  Before any `@import` lines.  ### Paragraph indention  To mimic the look of type set in a printed book or manuscript you may want to enable paragraph indention. When `$paragraph-indent` is set to `true` indents are added to each sibling and the margin below each paragraph is removed.        Example of indented paragraphs.   The size of the indent can also be customized by changing the value of `$indent-var`.  ### Font stacks  By default the theme uses [system fonts](https://medium.com/designing-medium/system-shock-6b1dc6d6596f#.rb81vgn7i) for all of the font stacks (serif, sans-serif, and monospace). This is done in part to provide a clean base for you to build off of and to improve performance since we aren't loading any custom webfonts by default.  ```scss /* system typefaces */ $serif      : Georgia, Times, serif; $sans-serif : -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, \"Roboto\", \"Segoe UI\", \"Helvetica Neue\", \"Lucida Grande\", Arial, sans-serif; $monospace  : Monaco, Consolas, \"Lucida Console\", monospace; ```  Sans-serif fonts have been used for most of the type, with serifs reserved for captions. If you wish to change this you'll need to poke around the various `SCSS` partials and modify `font-family` declarations.  **ProTip:** To use webfonts from services like [Adobe TypeKit](https://typekit.com/) or [Google Fonts](https://www.google.com/fonts) simply update the font stacks and then add their scripts to `_includes/head/custom.html`. {: .notice--info}  #### Typography from older versions  Not a fan of the refreshed typography of the theme and want to revert back an older version? Easy enough.  **1.** Add this Google Fonts script to [`_includes/head/custom.html`](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/blob/master/_includes/head/custom.html):  ```html  ```  **2.** Update the following SCSS variables:  ```scss $serif              : \"PT Serif\", Georgia, Times, serif; $sans-serif-narrow  : \"PT Sans Narrow\", -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, \"Roboto\", \"Segoe UI\", \"Helvetica Neue\", \"Lucida Grande\", Arial, sans-serif;  $global-font-family : $serif; $header-font-family : $sans-serif-narrow; ```  ### Type scale  Wherever possible type scale variables have been used instead of writing out fixed sizes. This makes updating much easier by changing values in one file.  Example:  ```scss .page__lead {   font-family: $global-font-family;   font-size: $type-size-4; } ```  Type sizes are set in ems to proportional scale as the screen size changes. Large headlines that look great on desktop monitors will shrink ever so slightly as to not be too big on mobile devices. To adjust this hierarchy simply edit the default values:  ```scss /* type scale */ $type-size-1 : 2.441em;  // ~39.056px $type-size-2 : 1.953em;  // ~31.248px $type-size-3 : 1.563em;  // ~25.008px $type-size-4 : 1.25em;   // ~20px $type-size-5 : 1em;      // ~16px $type-size-6 : 0.75em;   // ~12px $type-size-7 : 0.6875em; // ~11px $type-size-8 : 0.625em;  // ~10px ```  ### Colors  Change the mood of your site by altering a few color variables. `$body-color`, `$background-color`, `$text-color`, `$link-color`, and `$masthead-link-color` will have the most affect when changed.  #### Syntax highlighting  To make customizing the colors used in code highlighted blocks, a base of sixteen colors ([Base16](http://chriskempson.com/projects/base16/)) have been used.  Code block colors can easily be changed by overriding any of the following color variables:  ##### Default  ![default-code-block]({{ '/assets/images/default-code-block.jpg' | relative_url }})  ```scss /* default syntax highlighting (base16) */ $base00: #263238; $base01: #2e3c43; $base02: #314549; $base03: #546e7a; $base04: #b2ccd6; $base05: #eeffff; $base06: #eeffff; $base07: #ffffff; $base08: #f07178; $base09: #f78c6c; $base0a: #ffcb6b; $base0b: #c3e88d; $base0c: #89ddff; $base0d: #82aaff; $base0e: #c792ea; $base0f: #ff5370; ```  ##### Solarized light  ![solarized-light-code-block]({{ '/assets/images/solarized-light-code-block.jpg' | relative_url }})  ```scss /* solarized light syntax highlighting (base16) */ $base00: #fafafa !default; $base01: #073642 !default; $base02: #586e75 !default; $base03: #657b83 !default; $base04: #839496 !default; $base05: #586e75 !default; $base06: #eee8d5 !default; $base07: #fdf6e3 !default; $base08: #dc322f !default; $base09: #cb4b16 !default; $base0a: #b58900 !default; $base0b: #859900 !default; $base0c: #2aa198 !default; $base0d: #268bd2 !default; $base0e: #6c71c4 !default; $base0f: #d33682 !default; ```  ##### Contrast  ![contrast-code-block]({{ '/assets/images/contrast-code-block.jpg' | relative_url }})  ```scss /* contrast syntax highlighting (base16) */ $base00: #000000; $base01: #242422; $base02: #484844; $base03: #6c6c66; $base04: #918f88; $base05: #b5b3aa; $base06: #d9d7cc; $base07: #fdfbee; $base08: #ff6c60; $base09: #e9c062; $base0a: #ffffb6; $base0b: #a8ff60; $base0c: #c6c5fe; $base0d: #96cbfe; $base0e: #ff73fd; $base0f: #b18a3d; ```  ##### Dark  ![dark-code-block]({{ '/assets/images/dark-code-block.jpg' | relative_url }})  ```scss /* dark syntax highlighting (base16) */ $base00: #ffffff; $base01: #e0e0e0; $base02: #d0d0d0; $base03: #b0b0b0; $base04: #000000; $base05: #101010; $base06: #151515; $base07: #202020; $base08: #ff0086; $base09: #fd8900; $base0a: #aba800; $base0b: #00c918; $base0c: #1faaaa; $base0d: #3777e6; $base0e: #ad00a1; $base0f: #cc6633; ```  ##### Dirt  ![dirt-code-block]({{ '/assets/images/dirt-code-block.jpg' | relative_url }})  ```scss /* dirt syntax highlighting (base16) */ $base00: #231e18; $base01: #302b25; $base02: #48413a; $base03: #9d8b70; $base04: #b4a490; $base05: #cabcb1; $base06: #d7c8bc; $base07: #e4d4c8; $base08: #d35c5c; $base09: #ca7f32; $base0a: #e0ac16; $base0b: #b7ba53; $base0c: #6eb958; $base0d: #88a4d3; $base0e: #bb90e2; $base0f: #b49368; ```  ##### Dracula  ![dracula-code-block]({{ '/assets/images/dracula-code-block.jpg' | relative_url }})  ```scss /* dracula syntax highlighting (base16) */ /* https://github.com/dracula/base16-dracula-scheme */ $base00: #282936; $base01: #3a3c4e; $base02: #4d4f68; $base03: #626483; $base04: #62d6e8; $base05: #e9e9f4; $base06: #f1f2f8; $base07: #f7f7fb; $base08: #ea51b2; $base09: #b45bcf; $base0a: #00f769; $base0b: #ebff87; $base0c: #a1efe4; $base0d: #62d6e8; $base0e: #b45bcf; $base0f: #00f769; ```  ##### Neon  ![neon-code-block]({{ '/assets/images/neon-code-block.jpg' | relative_url }})  ```scss /* neon syntax highlighting (base16) */ $base00: #ffffff; $base01: #e0e0e0; $base02: #d0d0d0; $base03: #b0b0b0; $base04: #000000; $base05: #101010; $base06: #151515; $base07: #202020; $base08: #ff0086; $base09: #fd8900; $base0a: #aba800; $base0b: #00c918; $base0c: #1faaaa; $base0d: #3777e6; $base0e: #ad00a1; $base0f: #cc6633; ```  ##### Plum  ![plum-code-block]({{ '/assets/images/plum-code-block.jpg' | relative_url }})  ```scss /* plum syntax highlighting (base16) */ $base00: #ffffff; $base01: #e0e0e0; $base02: #d0d0d0; $base03: #b0b0b0; $base04: #000000; $base05: #101010; $base06: #151515; $base07: #202020; $base08: #ff0086; $base09: #fd8900; $base0a: #aba800; $base0b: #00c918; $base0c: #1faaaa; $base0d: #3777e6; $base0e: #ad00a1; $base0f: #cc6633; ```  ##### Sunrise  ![sunrise-code-block]({{ '/assets/images/sunrise-code-block.jpg' | relative_url }})  ```scss /* sunrise syntax highlighting (base16) */ $base00: #1d1f21; $base01: #282a2e; $base02: #373b41; $base03: #969896; $base04: #b4b7b4; $base05: #c5c8c6; $base06: #e0e0e0; $base07: #ffffff; $base08: #cc6666; $base09: #de935f; $base0a: #f0c674; $base0b: #b5bd68; $base0c: #8abeb7; $base0d: #81a2be; $base0e: #b294bb; $base0f: #a3685a; ```  ### Breakpoints and grid stuff  Probably won't need to touch these, but they're there if you need to. Width variables are used with the [`@include breakpoint()`](http://breakpoint-sass.com/) mixin to adapt the design of certain elements.  And `$susy` is used for setting [the grid](http://susy.oddbird.net/) the theme uses. Uncommenting the lines under `debug` can be useful if you want to show the columns when adjusting the layout.        Susy grid debug overlay enabled.   ### Disabling animations  You can disable either the fade-in intro animation, element transition animations, or both by overriding the corresponding variables. For example if you wanted to disable all animations you could include the following lines:  ```scss $intro-transition  : none; $global-transition : none; ``` ","categories": [],

        "excerpt":"The theme's `assets/js/main.min.js` script is built from several vendor, jQuery plugins, and other scripts found in [`assets/js/`](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/tree/master/assets/js).  ```bash minimal mistakes ├── assets |  ├── js |  |  ├── plugins |  |  |   ├── gumshoe.js                     # simple scrollspy |  |  |   ├── jquery.ba-throttle-debounce.js # rate-limit functions |  |  |   ├── jquery.fitvids.js              # fluid width video embeds |  |  |   ├── jquery.greedy-navigation.js    # priority plus navigation |  |  |   ├── jquery.magnific-popup.js       # responsive lightbox |  |  |   └── smooth-scroll.js               # make same-page links scroll smoothly |  |  ├── vendor |  |  |   └── jquery |  |  |       └── jquery-3.5.1.js |  |  ├── _main.js                           # jQuery plugin settings and other scripts |  |  └── main.min.js                        # concatenated and minified theme script ```  ## Customizing  To modify or add your own scripts include them in [`assets/js/_main.js`](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/blob/master/assets/js/_main.js) and then rebuild using `npm run build:js`. See below for more details.  If you add additional scripts to `assets/js/plugins/` and would like them concatenated with the others, be sure to update the `uglify` script in [`package.json`](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/blob/master/package.json). Same goes for scripts that you remove.  You can also add scripts to the `` or closing `` elements by adding paths to following arrays in `_config.yml`.  **Example:**  ```yaml head_scripts:   - https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.3.1.min.js   - /assets/js/your-custom-head-script.js footer_scripts:   - /assets/js/your-custom-footer-script.js after_footer_scripts:   - /assets/js/custom-script-loads-after-footer.js ```  **Note:** If you assign `footer_scripts` the theme's `/assets/js/main.min.js` file will be deactivated. This script includes jQuery and various other plugins that you'll need to find replacements for and include separately. {: .notice--warning}  ---  ## Build process  In an effort to reduce dependencies a set of [**npm scripts**](https://css-tricks.com/why-npm-scripts/) are used to build `main.min.js` instead of task runners like [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) or [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/). If those tools are more your style then by all means use them instead :wink:.  To get started:  1. Install [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/). 2. `cd` to the root of your project. 3. Install all of the dependencies by running `npm install`.  **Note:** If you upgraded from a previous version of the theme be sure you copied over [`package.json`](https://github.com/{{ site.repository }}/blob/master/package.json) prior to running `npm install`. {: .notice--warning}  If all goes well, running `npm run build:js` will compress/concatenate `_main.js` and all plugin scripts into `main.min.js`.  ## Debugging  The minified JavaScript is harder to debug in the browser than the raw source. To stop the minification and bundle all the JavaScript as-is --- open up `package.json` and edit the value `scripts.uglify` from:  ```json   \"scripts\": {     \"uglify\": \"uglifyjs [...] -c -m -o assets/js/main.min.js\", ```  To the following:  ```json   \"scripts\": {     \"uglify\": \"cat [...] > assets/js/main.min.js\", ``` ","categories": [],

        "excerpt":"## Installation  Minimal Mistakes now requires [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) 3.0. Make sure to run `bundle update` if you aren't on the latest version to update all gem dependencies.  If you are creating a new Jekyll site using Minimal Mistakes follow these steps:  1. Fork the [Minimal Mistakes repo](http://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/fork). 2. Clone the repo you just forked and rename it. 3. [Install Bundler](http://bundler.io) `gem install bundler` and Run `bundle install` to install all dependencies (Jekyll, [Jekyll-Sitemap](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-sitemap), [Octopress](https://github.com/octopress/octopress), etc) 4. Update `config.yml`, add navigation, and replace demo posts and pages with your own. Full details below.  If you want to use Minimal Mistakes with an existing Jekyll site follow these steps:  1. [Download Minimal Mistakes](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/releases/tag/2.2.1) and unzip. 2. Rename `minimal-mistakes-master` to something meaningful ie: `new-site` 3. Run `bundle install` to install all dependencies (Jekyll, [Jekyll-Sitemap](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-sitemap), [Octopress](https://github.com/octopress/octopress), etc) 4. Remove demo posts/pages and replace with your own posts, pages, and any other content you want to move over. 5. Update posts' and pages' YAML to match variables used by Minimal Mistakes. Full details below. 6. Update `_config.yml` and add navigation links. Full details below.  **Pro-tip:** Delete the `gh-pages` branch after cloning and start fresh by branching off `master`. There is a bunch of garbage in `gh-pages` used for the theme's demo site that I'm guessing you won't want. {: .notice}  ## Running Jekyll  The preferred method for running Jekyll is with `bundle exec`, but if you're willing to deal gem conflicts feel free to go cowboy with a `jekyll serve` or `jekyll build`.  > In some cases, running executables without bundle exec may work, if the executable happens to be installed in your system and does not pull in any gems that conflict with your bundle. > >However, this is unreliable and is the source of considerable pain. Even if it looks like it works, it may not work in the future or on another machine.  ```bash bundle exec jekyll serve ```  ## Scaffolding  How Minimal Mistakes is organized and what the various files are. All posts, layouts, includes, stylesheets, assets, and whatever else is grouped nicely under the root folder. The compiled Jekyll site outputs to `_site/`.  ```bash minimal-mistakes/ ├── _includes/ |    ├── author-bio.html        # bio stuff layout. pulls optional owner data from _config.yml |    ├── browser-upgrade   # prompt to install a modern browser for `. When developing locally either comment this out or use something like `http://localhost:4000` so all assets load properly. *Don't include a trailing `/`*.  Examples:  ```yaml url: http://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes url: http://localhost:4000 url: //cooldude.github.io url: ```  #### Google Analytics and Webmaster Tools  Google Analytics UA and Webmaster Tool verification tags can be entered under `owner` in `_config.yml`. For more information on obtaining these meta tags check [Google Webmaster Tools](http://support.google.com/webmasters/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=35179) and [Bing Webmaster Tools](https://ssl.bing.com/webmaster/configure/verify/ownership) support.  ### Navigation Links  To set what links appear in the top navigation edit `_data/navigation.yml`. Use the following format to set the URL and title for as many links as you'd like. *External links will open in a new window.*  ```yaml - title: Portfolio   url: /portfolio/  - title: Made Mistakes   url: http://mademistakes.com ```  ## Adding New Content with Octopress  While completely optional, I've included Octopress and some starter templates to automate the creation of new posts and pages. To take advantage of it start by installing the [Octopress](https://github.com/octopress/octopress) gem if it isn't already.  ```bash $ gem install octopress ```  ### New Post  Default command  ```bash $ octopress new post \"Post Title\" ```  Default works great if you want all your posts in one directory, but if you're like me and want to group them into subfolders like `/posts`, `/portfolio`, etc. Then this is the command for you. By specifying the DIR it will create a new post in that folder and populate the `categories:` YAML with the same value.  ```bash $ octopress new post \"New Portfolio Post Title\" --dir portfolio ```  ### New Page  To create a new page use the following command.  ```bash $ octopress new page new-page/ ```  This will create a page at `/new-page/index.md`  ## Layouts and Content  Explanations of the various `_layouts` included with the theme and when to use them.  ### Post and Page  These two layouts are very similar. Both have an author sidebar, allow for large feature images at the top, and optional Disqus comments. The only real difference is the post layout includes related posts at the end of the page.  ### Post Index Page  A [sample index page]({{ site.url }}/posts/) listing all posts grouped by the year they were published has been provided. The name can be customized to your liking by editing a few references. For example, to change **Posts** to **Writing** update the following:  In `_config.yml` under `links:` rename the title and URL to the following:  ```yaml   links:   - title: Writing     url: /writing/ ```  * Rename `posts/index.md` to `writing/index.md` and update the YAML front matter accordingly. * Update the **View all posts** link in the `post.html` layout found in `_layouts` to match title and URL set previously.  ### Feature Images  A good rule of thumb is to keep feature images nice and wide so you don't push the body text too far down. An image cropped around around 1024 x 256 pixels will keep file size down with an acceptable resolution for most devices. If you want to serve these images responsively I'd suggest looking at the [Jekyll Picture Tag](https://github.com/robwierzbowski/jekyll-picture-tag) plugin[^plugins].  [^plugins]: If you're using GitHub Pages to host your site be aware that plugins are disabled. You'll need to build your site locally and then manually deploy if you want to use this sweet plugin.  The post and page layouts make the assumption that the feature images live in the `images/` folder. To add a feature image to a post or page just include the filename in the front matter like so. It's probably best to host all your images from this folder, but you can hotlink from external sources if you desire.  ```yaml image:   feature: feature-image-filename.jpg   thumb: thumbnail-image.jpg #keep it square 200x200 px is good ```  To add attribution to a feature image use the following YAML front matter on posts or pages. Image credits appear directly below the feature image with a link back to the original source if supplied.  ```yaml image:   feature: feature-image-filename.jpg   credit: Michael Rose #name of the person or site you want to credit   creditlink: http://mademistakes.com #url to their site or licensing ```  ### Thumbnails for OG and Twitter Cards  Feature and thumbnail images are used by [Open Graph](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/opengraph/) and [Twitter Cards](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/cards) as well. If you don't assign a thumbnail the default graphic *(default-thumb.png)* is used. I'd suggest changing this to something more meaningful --- your logo or avatar are good options.  **Pro-Tip**: You need to [apply for Twitter Cards](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/cards) before they will begin showing up when links to your site are shared. {:.notice}  ### Author Override  By making use of data files you can assign different authors for each post.  Start by modifying `authors.yml` file in the `_data` folder and add your authors using the following format.  ```yaml # Authors  billy_rick:   name        : \"Billy Rick\"   web         : \"http://thewhip.com\"   email       : \"billy@rick.com\"   bio         : \"What do you want, jewels? I am a very extravagant man.\"   avatar      : \"bio-photo-2.jpg\"   twitter     : \"extravagantman\"   google_plus : \"BillyRick\"  cornelius_fiddlebone:   name        : \"Cornelius Fiddlebone\"   email       : \"cornelius@thewhip.com\"   bio         : \"I ordered what?\"   avatar      : \"bio-photo.jpg\"   twitter     : \"rhymeswithsackit\"   google_plus : \"CorneliusFiddlebone\" ```  To assign Billy Rick as an author for our post. We'd add the following YAML front matter to a post:  ```yaml author: billy_rick ```  ### Kramdown Table of Contents  To include an auto-generated **table of contents** for posts and pages, add the following `_include` before the actual content. [Kramdown will take care of the rest](http://kramdown.rubyforge.org/converter/html.html#toc) and convert all headlines into list of links.  ```html {% raw %}{% include toc.html %}{% endraw %} ```  ### Paragraph Indentation  By default the margin below paragraphs has been removed and indent added to each. This is an intentional design decision to mimic the look of type set in a printed book or manuscript.        Example of the default paragraph style (indented first line and bottom margin removed).   To disable the indents and add spacing between paragraphs change the following line in `_sass/variables.scss` from `true !default` to `false` like so.  ```scss $paragraph-indent: false; ```        Example of paragraphs with $paragraph-indent disabled.   ### Videos  Video embeds are responsive and scale with the width of the main content block with the help of [FitVids](http://fitvidsjs.com/).  Not sure if this only effects Kramdown or if it's an issue with Markdown in general. But adding YouTube video embeds causes errors when building your Jekyll site. To fix add a space between the `` tags and remove `allowfullscreen`. Example below:  ```html   ```  ### Social Sharing Links  Social sharing links for Twitter, Facebook, and Google+ are included on posts/pages by default. To hide them on specific posts or pages add `share: false` to the YAML Front Matter. If you'd like to use different social networks modify `_includes/social-share` to your liking. Icons are set using [Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io).  ## Further Customization  Jekyll 2.x added support for Sass files making it much easier to modify a theme's fonts and colors. By editing values found in `_sass/variables.scss` you can fine tune the site's colors and typography.  For example if you wanted a red background instead of white you'd change `$bodycolor: #fff;` to `$bodycolor: $cc0033;`.  To modify the site's JavaScript files I setup a Grunt build script to lint/concatenate/minify all scripts into `scripts.min.js`. [Install Node.js](http://nodejs.org/), then [install Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started), and then finally install the dependencies for the theme contained in `package.json`:  ```bash npm install ```  From the theme's root, use `grunt` concatenate JavaScript files, and optimize .jpg, .png, and .svg files in the `images/` folder. You can also use `grunt dev` in combination with `jekyll build --watch` to watch for updates JS files that Grunt will then automatically re-build as you write your code which will in turn auto-generate your Jekyll site when developing locally.","categories": [],

One day when she was two years old she was playing in a garden, and she plucked another flower and ran with it to her mother. I suppose she must have looked rather delightful, for Mrs. Darling put her hand to her heart and cried, \"Oh, why can't you remain like this for ever!\" This was all that passed between them on the subject, but henceforth Wendy knew that she must grow up. You always know after you are two. Two is the beginning of the end.  Mrs. Darling first heard of Peter when she was tidying up her children's minds. It is the nightly custom of every good mother after her children are asleep to rummage in their minds and put things straight for next morning, repacking into their proper places the many articles that have wandered during the day.    This post has a manual excerpt `` set after the second paragraph. The following YAML Front Matter has also be applied:  ```yaml excerpt_separator: \"\" ```  If you could keep awake (but of course you can't) you would see your own mother doing this, and you would find it very interesting to watch her. It is quite like tidying up drawers. You would see her on her knees, I expect, lingering humorously over some of your contents, wondering where on earth you had picked this thing up, making discoveries sweet and not so sweet, pressing this to her cheek as if it were as nice as a kitten, and hurriedly stowing that out of sight. When you wake in the morning, the naughtiness and evil passions with which you went to bed have been folded up small and placed at the bottom of your mind and on the top, beautifully aired, are spread out your prettier thoughts, ready for you to put on.  I don't know whether you have ever seen a map of a person's mind. Doctors sometimes draw maps of other parts of you, and your own map can become intensely interesting, but catch them trying to draw a map of a child's mind, which is not only confused, but keeps going round all the time. There are zigzag lines on it, just like your temperature on a card, and these are probably roads in the island, for the Neverland is always more or less an island, with astonishing splashes of colour here and there, and coral reefs and rakish-looking craft in the offing, and savages and lonely lairs, and gnomes who are mostly tailors, and caves through which a river runs, and princes with six elder brothers, and a hut fast going to decay, and one very small old lady with a hooked nose. It would be an easy map if that were all, but there is also first day at school, religion, fathers, the round pond, needle-work, murders, hangings, verbs that take the dative, chocolate pudding day, getting into braces, say ninety-nine, three-pence for pulling out your tooth yourself, and so on, and either these are part of the island or they are another map showing through, and it is all rather confusing, especially as nothing will stand still.  Of course the Neverlands vary a good deal. John's, for instance, had a lagoon with flamingoes flying over it at which John was shooting, while Michael, who was very small, had a flamingo with lagoons flying over it. John lived in a boat turned upside down on the sands, Michael in a wigwam, Wendy in a house of leaves deftly sewn together. John had no friends, Michael had friends at night, Wendy had a pet wolf forsaken by its parents, but on the whole the Neverlands have a family resemblance, and if they stood still in a row you could say of them that they have each other's nose, and so forth. On these magic shores children at play are for ever beaching their coracles [simple boat]. We too have been there; we can still hear the sound of the surf, though we shall land no more.  Of all delectable islands the Neverland is the snuggest and most compact, not large and sprawly, you know, with tedious distances between one adventure and another, but nicely crammed. When you play at it by day with the chairs and table-cloth, it is not in the least alarming, but in the two minutes before you go to sleep it becomes very real. That is why there are night-lights.  Occasionally in her travels through her children's minds Mrs. Darling found things she could not understand, and of these quite the most perplexing was the word Peter. She knew of no Peter, and yet he was here and there in John and Michael's minds, while Wendy's began to be scrawled all over with him. The name stood out in bolder letters than any of the other words, and as Mrs. Darling gazed she felt that it had an oddly cocky appearance.","categories": ["Post Formats"],

Now, on the St. Louis team we have Who's on first, What's on second, I Don't Know is on third--  Costello: That's what I want to find out. I want you to tell me the names of the fellows on the St. Louis team.  Abbott: I'm telling you. Who's on first, What's on second, I Don't Know is on third--  Costello: You know the fellows' names?  Abbott: Yes.  Costello: Well, then who's playing first?  Abbott: Yes.  Costello: I mean the fellow's name on first base.  Abbott: Who.  Costello: The fellow playin' first base.  Abbott: Who.  Costello: The guy on first base.  Abbott: Who is on first.  Costello: Well, what are you askin' me for?  Abbott: I'm not asking you--I'm telling you. Who is on first.

Abbott: Every dollar of it. And why not, the man's entitled to it.  Costello: Who is?  Abbott: Yes.  Costello: So who gets it?  Abbott: Why shouldn't he? Sometimes his wife comes down and collects it.  Costello: Who's wife?  Abbott: Yes. After all, the man earns it.  Costello: Who does?  Abbott: Absolutely.

Abbott: Who's on first!  Costello: St. Louis has a good outfield?  Abbott: Oh, absolutely.  Costello: The left fielder's name?  Abbott: Why.  Costello: I don't know, I just thought I'd ask.  Abbott: Well, I just thought I'd tell you.  Costello: Then tell me who's playing left field?  Abbott: Who's playing first.  Costello: Stay out of the infield! The left fielder's name?  Abbott: Why.  Costello: Because.  Abbott: Oh, he's center field.  Costello: Wait a minute. You got a pitcher on this team?  Abbott: Wouldn't this be a fine team without a pitcher?  Costello: Tell me the pitcher's name.  Abbott: Tomorrow.  Costello: Now, when the guy at bat bunts the ball--me being a good catcher--I want to throw the guy out at first base, so I pick up the ball and throw it to who?  Abbott: Now, that's he first thing you've said right.  Costello: I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT!  Abbott: Don't get excited. Take it easy.  Costello: I throw the ball to first base, whoever it is grabs the ball, so the guy runs to second. Who picks up the ball and throws it to what. What throws it to I don't know. I don't know throws it back to tomorrow--a triple play.  Abbott: Yeah, it could be.  Costello: Another guy gets up and it's a long ball to center.  Abbott: Because.  Costello: Why? I don't know.

If you could keep awake (but of course you can't) you would see your own mother doing this, and you would find it very interesting to watch her. It is quite like tidying up drawers. You would see her on her knees, I expect, lingering humorously over some of your contents, wondering where on earth you had picked this thing up, making discoveries sweet and not so sweet, pressing this to her cheek as if it were as nice as a kitten, and hurriedly stowing that out of sight. When you wake in the morning, the naughtiness and evil passions with which you went to bed have been folded up small and placed at the bottom of your mind and on the top, beautifully aired, are spread out your prettier thoughts, ready for you to put on.  I don't know whether you have ever seen a map of a person's mind. Doctors sometimes draw maps of other parts of you, and your own map can become intensely interesting, but catch them trying to draw a map of a child's mind, which is not only confused, but keeps going round all the time. There are zigzag lines on it, just like your temperature on a card, and these are probably roads in the island, for the Neverland is always more or less an island, with astonishing splashes of colour here and there, and coral reefs and rakish-looking craft in the offing, and savages and lonely lairs, and gnomes who are mostly tailors, and caves through which a river runs, and princes with six elder brothers, and a hut fast going to decay, and one very small old lady with a hooked nose. It would be an easy map if that were all, but there is also first day at school, religion, fathers, the round pond, needle-work, murders, hangings, verbs that take the dative, chocolate pudding day, getting into braces, say ninety-nine, three-pence for pulling out your tooth yourself, and so on, and either these are part of the island or they are another map showing through, and it is all rather confusing, especially as nothing will stand still.  Of course the Neverlands vary a good deal. John's, for instance, had a lagoon with flamingoes flying over it at which John was shooting, while Michael, who was very small, had a flamingo with lagoons flying over it. John lived in a boat turned upside down on the sands, Michael in a wigwam, Wendy in a house of leaves deftly sewn together. John had no friends, Michael had friends at night, Wendy had a pet wolf forsaken by its parents, but on the whole the Neverlands have a family resemblance, and if they stood still in a row you could say of them that they have each other's nose, and so forth. On these magic shores children at play are for ever beaching their coracles [simple boat]. We too have been there; we can still hear the sound of the surf, though we shall land no more.  Of all delectable islands the Neverland is the snuggest and most compact, not large and sprawly, you know, with tedious distances between one adventure and another, but nicely crammed. When you play at it by day with the chairs and table-cloth, it is not in the least alarming, but in the two minutes before you go to sleep it becomes very real. That is why there are night-lights.  Occasionally in her travels through her children's minds Mrs. Darling found things she could not understand, and of these quite the most perplexing was the word Peter. She knew of no Peter, and yet he was here and there in John and Michael's minds, while Wendy's began to be scrawled all over with him. The name stood out in bolder letters than any of the other words, and as Mrs. Darling gazed she felt that it had an oddly cocky appearance.","categories": [],

To attribute an author to a post or page that is different from the site author specified in `_config.yml`:  **Step 1.** Create `_data/authors.yml` and add authors using the following format. Anything variables found under `author` in `_config.yml` can be used (e.g. `name`, `bio`, `avatar`, author `links`, etc.).  ```yaml # /_data/authors.yml  Billy Rick:   name        : \"Billy Rick\"   bio         : \"What do you want, jewels? I am a very extravagant man.\"   avatar      : \"/assets/images/bio-photo-2.jpg\"   links:     - label: \"Email\"       icon: \"fas fa-fw fa-envelope-square\"       url: \"mailto:billyrick@rick.com\"     - label: \"Website\"       icon: \"fas fa-fw fa-link\"       url: \"https://thewhip.com\"     - label: \"Twitter\"       icon: \"fab fa-fw fa-twitter-square\"       url: \"https://twitter.com/extravagantman\"  Cornelius Fiddlebone:   name        : \"Cornelius Fiddlebone\"   bio         : \"I ordered what?\"   avatar      : \"/assets/images/bio-photo.jpg\"   links:     - label: \"Email\"       icon: \"fas fa-fw fa-envelope-square\"       url: \"mailto:cornelius@thewhip.com\"     - label: \"Twitter\"       icon: \"fab fa-fw fa-twitter-square\"       url: \"https://twitter.com/rhymeswithsackit\" ```  **Step 2.** Assign one of the authors in `authors.yml` to a post or page you wish to override the `site.author` with.

        "excerpt":"### Default  This is a paragraph. It should not have any alignment of any kind. It should just flow like you would normally expect. Nothing fancy. Just straight up text, free flowing, with love. Completely neutral and not picking a side or sitting on the fence. It just is. It just freaking is. It likes where it is. It does not feel compelled to pick a side. Leave him be. It will just be better that way. Trust me.  ### Left Align  This is a paragraph. It is left aligned. Because of this, it is a bit more liberal in it's views. It's favorite color is green. Left align tends to be more eco-friendly, but it provides no concrete evidence that it really is. Even though it likes share the wealth evenly, it leaves the equal distribution up to justified alignment. {: style=\"text-align: left;\"}  ### Center Align  This is a paragraph. It is center aligned. Center is, but nature, a fence sitter. A flip flopper. It has a difficult time making up its mind. It wants to pick a side. Really, it does. It has the best intentions, but it tends to complicate matters more than help. The best you can do is try to win it over and hope for the best. I hear center align does take bribes. {: style=\"text-align: center;\"}  ### Right Align  This is a paragraph. It is right aligned. It is a bit more conservative in it's views. It's prefers to not be told what to do or how to do it. Right align totally owns a slew of guns and loves to head to the range for some practice. Which is cool and all. I mean, it's a pretty good shot from at least four or five football fields away. Dead on. So boss. {: style=\"text-align: right;\"}  ### Justify Align  This is a paragraph. It is justify aligned. It gets really mad when people associate it with Justin Timberlake. Typically, justified is pretty straight laced. It likes everything to be in it's place and not all cattywampus like the rest of the aligns. I am not saying that makes it better than the rest of the aligns, but it does tend to put off more of an elitist attitude. {: style=\"text-align: justify;\"}","categories": ["Markup"],

        "excerpt":"Welcome to image alignment! The best way to demonstrate the ebb and flow of the various image positioning options is to nestle them snuggly among an ocean of words. Grab a paddle and let's get started.  ![image-center]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/image-alignment-580x300.jpg){: .align-center}  The image above happens to be **centered**.  ![image-left]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/image-alignment-150x150.jpg){: .align-left} The rest of this paragraph is filler for the sake of seeing the text wrap around the 150×150 image, which is **left aligned**.  As you can see there should be some space above, below, and to the right of the image. The text should not be creeping on the image. Creeping is just not right. Images need breathing room too. Let them speak like you words. Let them do their jobs without any hassle from the text. In about one more sentence here, we'll see that the text moves from the right of the image down below the image in seamless transition. Again, letting the do it's thing. Mission accomplished!  And now for a **massively large image**. It also has **no alignment**.  ![no-alignment]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/image-alignment-1200x4002.jpg)  The image above, though 1200px wide, should not overflow the content area. It should remain contained with no visible disruption to the flow of content.  ![image-right]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/image-alignment-300x200.jpg){: .align-right}  And now we're going to shift things to the **right align**. Again, there should be plenty of room above, below, and to the left of the image. Just look at him there --- Hey guy! Way to rock that right side. I don't care what the left aligned image says, you look great. Don't let anyone else tell you differently.  In just a bit here, you should see the text start to wrap below the right aligned image and settle in nicely. There should still be plenty of room and everything should be sitting pretty. Yeah --- Just like that. It never felt so good to be right.  And just when you thought we were done, we're going to do them all over again with captions!        Look at 580 x 300 getting some love.    The figure above happens to be **centered**. The caption also has a link in it, just to see if it does anything funky.        Itty-bitty caption.    The rest of this paragraph is filler for the sake of seeing the text wrap around the 150×150 image, which is **left aligned**.  As you can see there should be some space above, below, and to the right of the image. The text should not be creeping on the image. Creeping is just not right. Images need breathing room too.

And now for a **massively large image**. It also has **no alignment**.        Massive image comment for your eyeballs.    The figure element above has an inline style of `width: 1200px` set which should break it outside of the normal content flow.        Feels good to be right all the time.    And now we're going to shift things to the **right align**. Again, there should be plenty of room above, below, and to the left of the image. Just look at him there --- Hey guy!

If you're interested in testing out Minimal Mistakes as a gemified theme read on. There are a few caveats though:  1. Support for a theme `assets` folder was recently [added to Jekyll core](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/pull/5364), but has yet to be released or rolled into the `github-pages` gem. Meaning you can't use Minimal Mistakes as a Ruby gem there just yet... locally served or self-hosted installs should be fine if you don't mind using a pre-release version of Jekyll.  2. Windows users can't currently use themes packaged as gems due to a [bug with file paths](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/issues/5192) in Jekyll core. This is being worked on so hopefully a [fix is on the way](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/pull/5256) soon.  Fine with all that? Great. Let's continue.  If you're migrating a site already using Minimal Mistakes and haven't customized any of the `_includes`, `_layouts`, `_sass` partials, or `assets` this should be quick and painless.  ## Step 1: Remove Theme Files   Remove `_includes`, `_layouts`, `_sass`, `assets` folders and files within. You won't need these anymore as they're bundled in the theme.  If you customized any of these then leave them alone and only remove the untouched ones. If setup correctly your modified versions should act as [overrides](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/themes/#overriding-theme-defaults) to the versions bundled with the theme.  ## Step 2: Update `Gemfile`  In order to test you'll need to install pre-release gems of Jekyll and Minimal Mistakes.  Start by replacing `gem \"github-pages\"` or `gem \"jekyll\"` with the following:  ```ruby gem \"jekyll\", :git => \"https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll.git\" ```  Then add the pre-release Minimal Mistakes theme gem:   ```ruby gem \"minimal-mistakes-jekyll\", :git => \"https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes.git\", :branch => \"feature/theme-gem\"` ```  When finished your `Gemfile` should look something like this:  ```ruby source \"https://rubygems.org\"  gem \"jekyll\", :git => \"https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll.git\" gem \"minimal-mistakes-jekyll\", :git => \"https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes.git\", :branch => \"feature/theme-gem\"  group :jekyll_plugins do   # gem \"jekyll-archives\"   gem \"jekyll-paginate\"   gem \"jekyll-sitemap\"   gem \"jekyll-gist\"   gem \"jekyll-feed\" end ```  ## Step 3: Run Bundler  Run `bundle install` (or `bundle update` if you're updating an existing repo) to install the pre-release gems.  ## Step 4: Install the Theme  Add `theme: \"minimal-mistakes-jekyll\"` to your `_config.yml` file.  If you're migrating from an existing Minimal Mistakes site you shouldn't have to change anything else after this. If it's a new site consult then docs to [properly config]({{ \"/docs/configuration/\" | relative_url }}).  **Please Note:** Paths for image headers, overlays, teasers, [galleries]({{ \"/docs/helpers/#gallery\" | relative_url }}), and [feature rows]({{ \"/docs/helpers/#feature-row\" | relative_url }}) have changed and now require a full path. Instead of just `image: filename.jpg` you'll need to use the full path eg: `image: assets/images/filename.jpg`. The preferred location is now `assets/images` but can be placed elsewhere or external hosted. This applies for image references in `_config.yml` and `author.yml`. {: .notice--danger}  ## Step 5: `jekyll new` Tweaks  If this is a new site be sure to add the following files to `_data/` and customize as you see fit. There is currently no way of bundling them in with the theme, so be sure to consult the docs on how to properly use both.  - [`_data/ui-text.yml`](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/blob/master/_data/ui-text.yml) - UI text [documentation]({{ \"/docs/ui-text/\" | relative_url }}) - [`_data/navigation.yml`](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/blob/master/_data/navigation.yml) - navigation [documentation]({{ \"/docs/navigation/\" | relative_url }})  You'll also need to:   - Replace `/index.html` with a modified [Minimal Mistakes `index.html`](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/blob/master/index.html). - Change `layout: post` in `_posts/0000-00-00-welcome-to-jekyll.markdown` to `layout: single`. - Remove `about.md`, or at the very least change `layout: page` to `layout: single` and remove references to `icon-github.html` (or [copy to your `_includes`](https://github.com/jekyll/minima/tree/master/_includes) if using).  ---  That's it! If all goes well running `bundle exec jekyll serve` should spin-up your site. If you encounter any bumps please file an issue on GitHub and make sure to indicate you're testing the pre-release Ruby gem version.
